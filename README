This is ~red's current SlackBuilds repository and even hardly
maintained at some points, this is not official SlackBuilds git!
The purpose of this repository is to bring a little bit bleeding edge
softwares to Slackware;
Sure I want stable system, but I want latest daily softwares as well.
Slackware is damn good at system part, absolutely sucks at the rest.

I've modified sboui to specificly work with this repository, check it
out: https://github.com/RSKYS/SBo-git/tree/develop/system/sboui

Also mention that develop branch is basically programs we maintain
including their dependencies from others too as well, feel free to
apply https://codeload.github.com/RSKYS/SBo-git/zip/refs/heads/develop
to path of your sboui.
/var/lib/sboui/repo

If you have any pull requests, feel free contribute to "master" or if
it's new package "develop" can be other option too.
