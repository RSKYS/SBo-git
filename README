This is ~red's current SlackBuilds repository and even hardly
maintained at some points, this is not official SlackBuilds git!
The purpose of this repository is to bring a little bit bleeding edge
softwares to Slackware;
Sure I want stable system, but I want latest daily softwares as well.
Slackware is damn good at system part, absolutely sucks at the rest.

I've modified sboui to specificly work with this repository availble
under system/sboui.

This repo contains apps we maintain including their dependencies.

If you have any pull requests, feel free contribute to "master".
