## SBo-git

This is !red's current SlackBuilds repository and heavily maintained at some point, \
this is not official SlackBuilds git.

I've modified sboui to specifically work with this repository available under [system/sboui]. \
As well as [binary] under [frozen state]. \
*One of few basic UI package managers that won't let you down,* \
[the project] has my thanks.
