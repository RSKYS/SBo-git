This is ~red's current SlackBuilds repository and even heavily
maintained at some points, this is not official SlackBuilds git!

I've modified sboui to specifically work with this repository available
under [system/sboui](https://github.com/RSKYS/SBo-git/tree/current/system/sboui). \
As well as [binary](https://github.com/RSKYS/SBo-git/releases/download/2021-12-3/sboui-2.b1-x86_64-1red.txz) under [frozen state](https://github.com/RSKYS/SBo-git/releases). \
One of few basic UI package managers that won't let you down, \
[the project](https://github.com/montagdude/sboui) has my thanks.

This repo contains unofficial apps we maintain including their
dependencies. \
If you have any pull requests, feel free contribute to "master".
