  3D-ICE stands for 3D Interlayer Cooling Emulator. It is a
Linux-based Thermal Emulator Library written in C, which can perform
transient thermal analyses of vertically stacked 3D integrated
circuits with inter-tier Microchannel Liquid Cooling. The latest
version, namely 3D-ICE 3.1, supports fully customized non-uniform
thermal modeling and different heat sink models.


  If you want to enable the SystemC wrapper, set the environment
variable SYSTEMC=yes.
