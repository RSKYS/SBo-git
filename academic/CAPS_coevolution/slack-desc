# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

CAPS_coevolution: CAPS_coevolution (Coevolution Analysis using Protein Sequences)
CAPS_coevolution:
CAPS_coevolution: CAPS is aimed at measuring the coevolution between amino acid
CAPS_coevolution: sites belonging to the same protein (intra-molecular coevolution)
CAPS_coevolution: or to two functionally or physically interacting proteins (inter-
CAPS_coevolution: molecular coevolution). In addition, a test which assesses
CAPS_coevolution: whether two proteins are interacting is implemented.
