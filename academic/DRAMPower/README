  DRAMPower is an open source tool for fast and accurate DRAM power
and energy estimation for DRAM memories. The latest version of
the tool is v4.0 and features many important improvements, such as
significantly improved analysis speed (at least 10x), enabling
analysis of much larger traces, as well as support for DDR2/DDR3,
LPDDR/LPDDR2, DDR4 and Wide I/O memories. The tool is based on the
DRAM power model developed jointly by the Computer Engineering
Research Group at TU Delft and the Electronic Systems Group at
TU Eindhoven and has been verified by the Microelectronic System
Design Research Group at TU Kaiserslautern with equivalent
circuit-level simulations, which established that the error of
the tool to be < 2% for all memory operations of any granularity
for all memories supported by DRAMPower. DRAMPower is also part
of the computer architecture simulator gem5.


  Invocation example:
  # drampower -m /usr/share/DRAMPower-4.1/memspecs/MICRON_1Gb_DDR3-\
1066_8bit_G.xml -c /usr/share/DRAMPower-4.1/traces/commands.trace

  Examples of using the library are located at:
  # /usr/share/DRAMPower-4.1/examples/libdrampowertest

  You can copy them to a working dir and then run "make test" for 
testing, as following:
  # cp -av /usr/share/DRAMPower-4.1/examples/libdrampowertest .
  # cd libdrampowertest
  # make test
