# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

DRAMSim2: DRAMSim2 (A cycle accurate DRAM simulator)
DRAMSim2:
DRAMSim2:
DRAMSim2:   DRAMSim2 is a cycle accurate model of a DRAM memory controller, the
DRAMSim2: DRAM modules which comprise system storage, and the bus by which they
DRAMSim2: communicate. All major components in a modern memory system are
DRAMSim2: modeled as their own respective objects within the source, including:
DRAMSim2: ranks, banks, command queue, the memory controller, etc.
