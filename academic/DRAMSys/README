  DRAMSys4.0 is a flexible DRAM subsystem design space exploration
framework based on SystemC TLM-2.0. It was developed at the
Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group and Fraunhofer IESE.


  If you want to enable power simulation set the environment variable
POWER=yes, this requires the package DRAMPower.
  If you want to run thermal simulations install 3D-ICE with SystemC
wrapper enabled.
