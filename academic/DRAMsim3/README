  DRAMsim3 models the timing paramaters and memory controller behavior
for several DRAM protocols such as DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR3, LPDDR4, GDDR5,
GDDR6, HBM, HMC, STT-MRAM. It is implemented in C++ as an objected
oriented model that includes a parameterized DRAM bank model, DRAM
controllers, command queues and system-level interfaces to interact
with a CPU simulator (GEM5, ZSim) or trace workloads. It is designed
to be accurate, portable and parallel.
