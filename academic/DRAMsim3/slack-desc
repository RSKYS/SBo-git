# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

DRAMsim3: DRAMsim3 (DRAM simulator)
DRAMsim3:
DRAMsim3:  DRAMsim3 models the timing paramaters and memory controller behavior
DRAMsim3: for several DRAM protocols such as DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR3, LPDDR4, GDDR5,
DRAMsim3: GDDR6, HBM, HMC, STT-MRAM. It is implemented in C++ as an objected
DRAMsim3: oriented model that includes a parameterized DRAM bank model, DRAM
DRAMsim3: controllers, command queues and system-level interfaces to interact
DRAMsim3: with a CPU simulator (GEM5, ZSim) or trace workloads. It is designed
DRAMsim3: to be accurate, portable and parallel.
