Flow cytometry software is a perfect way to analyse complex data sets
with large sample size. Data can be easily visualized to identify
correlations and subpopulations. Subpopulations can be selected and
analysed separately. However, such software requires data in the FCS
data standard.

This contains two programs: Data2FCS and FCS2Data.

Data2FCS a simple application for converting data in ascii file format
into FCS3.1 files.  A special treat is the possibility to transform
categorical data into numerical data. The resulting FCS data file can be
analysed in regular flow cytometry softwares, such as the open source
FCSaylzer (also available at SlackBuilds.org).

FCS2Data is a simple application for converting FCS data files into
ascii file format. These files contain the single event data of the FCS
files, so that the data can be used in other applications.
