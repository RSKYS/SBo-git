DendroPy Phylogenetic Computing Library

DendroPy is a Python library for phylogenetic computing. It provides
classes and functions for the simulation, processing, and manipulation
of phylogenetic trees and character matrices, and supports the reading
and writing of phylogenetic data in a range of formats, such as NEXUS,
NEWICK, NeXML, Phylip, FASTA, etc. Application scripts for performing
some useful phylogenetic operations, such as data conversion and tree
posterior distribution summarization, are also distributed and installed
as part of the libary. DendroPy can thus function as a stand-alone
library for phylogenetics, a component of more complex multi-library
phyloinformatic pipelines, or as a scripting "glue" that assembles and
drives such pipelines.
