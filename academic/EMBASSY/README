EMBASSY includes applications with the same look and feel as EMBOSS
applications, but which the author wishes to be kept separate from
EMBOSS. This is usually because the packages are for specialised
sequence analysis or for non-sequence based analysis, or are licensed
differently to EMBOSS (i.e. non GPL).

EMBASSY includes the following: CBSTOOLS, CLUSTALOMEGA, DOMAINATRIX,
DOMALIGN, DOMSEARCH, DOMSEARCH, EMNU, ESIM4, HMMER, IPRSCAN, MEME,
MSE, MYEMBOSS, MYEMBOSSDEMO, PHYLIPNEW, SIGNATURE, STRUCTURE, TOPO and
VIENNA. For a more detailed description check the CONTENTS file.
