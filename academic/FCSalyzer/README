FCSalyzer: a free program for analysing flow cytometry data.

FCSalyzer is a simple application for analysing flow cytometry data. It
is based on the "What you see is what you get" principle with the hope
of being intuitive to use. For more information, visit the project web-
page.

Features:

- Analyses FCS2.0 list mode files and FCS3 files
- What you see is what you get - plots are placed onto a paginated
  document
- Dot plots, density plots and histograms - all with overlays
- Plots can be duplicated with their statistics

Supported datafiles (depending on the type of flow cytometer and
acquisition software) are listed in "datafiles.txt", found in the
documentation folder of the created package.
