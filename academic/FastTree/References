These papers describe FastTree: the first paper describes FastTree 1.0,
and the second paper describes heuristic minimum-evolution SPR moves,
maximum-likelihood NNIs, and SH-like local supports. We have also
eliminated the O(N2) steps in the neighbor-joining phase, and
implemented maximum-likelihood NNI moves and SH-like supports (see the
ChangeLog).
