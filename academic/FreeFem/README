FreeFem is a high level multiphysics finite element software

FreeFEM is a popular 2D and 3D partial differential equations (PDE)
solver used by thousands of researchers across the world. It allows
you to easily implement your own physics modules using the provided
FreeFEM language. FreeFEM offers a large list of finite elements,
like the Lagrange, Taylor-Hood, etc., usable in the continuous and
discontinuous Galerkin method framework.

FreeFEM has it own internal mesher, called BAMG, and is compatible
with the best open-source mesh and visualization software like Tetgen,
Gmsh, Mmg and ParaView.  Written in C++ to optimize for speed, FreeFEM
is interfaced with the popular mumps, PETSc and HPDDM solvers.
