Gblocks is a program written in ANSI C language that eliminates poorly
aligned positions and divergent regions of an alignment of DNA or
protein sequences. These positions may not be homologous or may have
been saturated by multiple substitutions and it is convenient to
eliminate them prior to phylogenetic analysis.

The use of a program such as Gblocks reduces the necessity of manually
editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic
analysis of large data sets feasible and, finally, facilitates the
reproduction of the alignments and subsequent phylogenetic analysis by
other researchers. Gblocks is very fast in processing alignments and
it is therefore highly suitable for large-scale phylogenetic analyses.

This just repackages the binaries provided from upstream.
