# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

HMMER: HMMER (Biosequence analysis using profile hidden Markov models)
HMMER:
HMMER: HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for sequence
HMMER: homologs, and for making sequence alignments. It implements
HMMER: methods using probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov
HMMER: models (profile HMMs).
