Kst (KDE4 Plotting Tool)

Kst is the fastest real-time large-dataset viewing and plotting tool
available and has built-in data analysis functionality.

Kst is very user-friendly (both the community and the program itself!).

Kst contains many powerful built-in features and is expandable with
plugins and extensions.

Kst is licensed under the GPL, and is as such freely available for
anyone.

Note that KDE libraries are an optional dependency (i.e. you can run Kst
without KDE, but you get additional features when running on a platform
with KDE).

Optional dependencies are: 
- netcdf (which provides support for files in the netCDF format)
- muParser (which is used in the general non-linear fitting plugin)
- GetData (which provides support for files in the Dirfile format)
- matio (which is used to read Matlab binary files)
