MetaPhlAn2 is a computational tool for profiling the composition of
microbial communities (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes) from meta-
genomic shotgun sequencing data (i.e. not 16S) with species-level.

With the newly added StrainPhlAn module, it is now possible to perform
accurate strain-level microbial profiling. MetaPhlAn2 relies on ~1.5M
unique clade-specific marker genes. The latest marker information file
`mpa_v29_CHOCOPhlAn_201901_marker_info.txt.bz2` can be found in the

identified from ~100,000 reference genomes (~99,500 bacterial and
archaeal and ~500 eukaryotic), allowing:

* unambiguous taxonomic assignments;
* accurate estimation of organismal relative abundance;
* species-level resolution for bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, viruses;
* strain identification and tracking
* orders of magnitude speedups compared to existing methods.
* metagenomic strain-level population genomics

NOTE!
The script places the python files in /usr/share/MetaPhlAn2 and creates
symlinks to /usr/bin. If you are using metaphlan2.py with Ugene, it may
not work with the symlink. Instead, just point Ugene directly to
/usr/share/MetaPhlAn2/metaphlan2.py
