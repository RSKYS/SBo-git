# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

MetaPhlAn2: MetaPhlAn2 (Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis)
MetaPhlAn2:
MetaPhlAn2: MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of
MetaPhlAn2: microbial communities from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.
MetaPhlAn2: MetaPhlAn relies on unique clade-specific marker genes identified
MetaPhlAn2: from ~17,000 reference genomes (~13,500 bacterial and archaeal,
MetaPhlAn2: ~3,500 viral, and ~110 eukaryotic).
