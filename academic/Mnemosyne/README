Mnemosyne aims to be a user-friendly flash card program,
with a clean, deceptively simple interface that does not
require you to wrap your head around complicated concepts
before you can start using it. At the same time, under the hood
it is very powerful, and its architecture allows infinite
extensibility and customisibility through plugins and a
scripting API, for the benefit of power users.
