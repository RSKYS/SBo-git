# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

OpenFOAM: OpenFOAM (computational fluid dynamics)
OpenFOAM:
OpenFOAM: OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to simulate anything from
OpenFOAM: turbulent flows in automotive aerodynamics, to fires and fire
OpenFOAM: suppression in buildings, involving combustion, chemical reactions,
OpenFOAM: heat transfer, liquid sprays and films. It includes tools for meshing
OpenFOAM: in and around complex geometries (e.g. a vehicle), and for data
OpenFOAM: processing and visualisation, and more. Almost all computations can be
OpenFOAM: executed in parallel as standard to take full advantage of today's
OpenFOAM: multi-core processors and multi-processor computers.
