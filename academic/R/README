R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation,
calculation and graphical display. It includes

* an effective data handling and storage facility,

* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular
matrices,

* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for
data analysis,

* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen
or on hardcopy, and

* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which
includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and
input and output facilities.

Notes:

If you do not need to build the R shared library (which is needed if
you would like to call R functions from other applications), execute
the script as R_SHLIB=no ./R.SlackBuild

If you do not need to build the BLAS shared library (which is useful
for swapping default unaccelerated BLAS for an accelerated one),
execute the script as BLAS_SHLIB=no ./R.SlackBuild

This package builds R from source; example build time (Intel Core
i7-7500U) is < 10 minutes.
