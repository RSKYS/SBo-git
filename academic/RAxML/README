RAxML - Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood

RAxML is a program for sequential and parallel Maximum Likelihood (ML)
based inference of large phylogenetic trees. It can also be used for
postanalyses of sets of phylogenetic trees, analyses of alignments and,
evolutionary placement of short reads.

NOTE!
The script builds single threaded and mpi versions of the executable
with Slackware's default compiler flags. You are highly encouraged to
check the script for building with other flags and optimisations. This
will dramatically speed up RAxML on modern processors.

When using RAxML please cite the following paper: A. Stamatakis:

Large Phylogenies". In Bioinformatics, 2014
