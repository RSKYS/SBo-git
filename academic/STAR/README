STAR aligns short and long RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using
uncompressed suffix arrays, resulting in fast, accurate mapping.
STAR is capable of unbiased de novo detection of canonical splice
junctions, can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
transcripts and can map full-length RNA sequences. Comes with 
STARsolo for: mapping, demultiplexing and gene quantification for 
single cell RNA-seq (See STARmanual).
