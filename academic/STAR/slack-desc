# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

STAR: STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference)
STAR:
STAR: STAR aligns short and long RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using
STAR: uncompressed suffix arrays, resulting in fast, accurate mapping. STAR
STAR: is capable of unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, can
STAR: discover non-canonical splices and chimeric transcripts, can map full-
STAR: length RNA sequences and can be used for single cell RNA-seq mapping.
