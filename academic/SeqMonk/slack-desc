# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

SeqMonk: SeqMonk (A Mapped Sequence Analysis tool)
SeqMonk:
SeqMonk: SeqMonk is a tool for viewing and analysing mapped sequence data.
SeqMonk: It was initially written to cope with remapping experiment data
SeqMonk: from next generation sequencers, but could be applied to any
SeqMonk: dataset consisting of a series of mapped genomic regions. The
SeqMonk: program allows you to visualise the positions of your mapped
SeqMonk: regions against an annotated genome and to quantify the data in
SeqMonk: order to make comparisons between data sets.
