Shark is a fast, modular, feature-rich open-source C++ machine
learning library. It provides methods for linear and nonlinear
optimization, kernel-based learning algorithms, neural networks and
various other machine learning techniques (see the feature list
below). It serves as a powerful toolbox for real world applications
as well as research. Shark depends on Boost and CMake.

Optional dependencies: atlas, hdf5.
