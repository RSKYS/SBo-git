# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

SimEng: SimEng (framework for cycle-accurate processor simulator)
SimEng:
SimEng:   The Simulation Engine (SimEng) is a framework for building modern
SimEng: cycle-accurate processor simulators. It aims to be:
SimEng:   - Fast
SimEng:   - Easy to use and modify to desired configurations
SimEng:   - Scalable, supporting simulation of simple scalar cores, up to
SimEng:     superscalar out-of-order designs
SimEng:   - Capable of supporting a wide range of ISAs.
SimEng:   - Open source, with a permissive license to enable collaboration
SimEng:     across academia and industry
