# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

WordNet: expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of
WordNet: conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network
WordNet: of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the
WordNet: browser. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational
