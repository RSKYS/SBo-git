AMD is a set of routines for ordering a sparse matrix prior to
Cholesky factorization (or for LU factorization with diagonal
pivoting).  There are versions in both C and Fortran.  Note that this
software has nothing to do with AMD the company.  This package runs on
any platform.

This package is part of SuiteSparse.
