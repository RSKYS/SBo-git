Archaeopteryx: visualise, analyse and edit phylogenetic trees

Archaeopteryx is a software tool for the visualization, analysis, and
editing of potentially large and highly annotated phylogenetic trees.
Archaeopteryx (the successor to ATV) is entirely written in the Java
programming language and is based on the forester libraries.

Check /usr/share/archaeopteryx for an example configuration file (called
'_aptx_configuration_file.txt' or get one from the program's web-site).

For more configuration files and examples, visit the program's web-page
