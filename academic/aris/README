GNU Aris is a sequential proof program, designed to assist anyone
interested in solving logical proofs. Aris supports both propositional
and predicate logic, as well as Boolean algebra and arithmetical logic
in the form of abstract sequences. It uses a predefined set of both
inference and equivalence rules, however gives the user options to use
older proofs as lemmas, including Isabelle's Isar proofs.
