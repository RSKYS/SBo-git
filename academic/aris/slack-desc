# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

aris: GNU Aris is a sequential proof program, designed to assist anyone
aris: interested in solving logical proofs. Aris supports both propositional
aris: and predicate logic, as well as Boolean algebra and arithmetical logic
aris: in the form of abstract sequences. It uses a predefined set of both
aris: inference and equivalence rules, however gives the user options to use
aris: older proofs as lemmas, including Isabelle's Isar proofs.
