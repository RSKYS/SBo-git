Avogadro Application is the graphic user interface of Avogadro 2.

Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor designed for cross-platform 
use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, 
materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible rendering and 
a powerful plugin architecture. 

Managed by OpenChemistry, Avogadro 2 it is based on QT5 libraries and 
it is a rewrite of the old Avogadro 1.x.

By default avogadroapp is built with static libraries. If you
want to enable the building with shared libraries, pass the variable
SHARED=yes to the script:

   SHARED=yes ./avogadroapp.SlackBuild

Note that if you build avogadroapp with shared libraries, hdf5 is
not required as needed dependency.

Warning: the computational settings made through the Input Generator
require the MoleQueue server running to submit jobs to local
applications or remote HPC clusters.
