The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of
freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology.

The Biopython web site provides an online resource for modules,
scripts, and web links for developers of Python-based software for
bioinformatics use and research. Basically, the goal of Biopython is
to make it as easy as possible to use Python for bioinformatics by
creating high-quality, reusable modules and classes. Biopython
features include parsers for various Bioinformatics file formats
(BLAST, Clustalw, FASTA, Genbank,...), access to online services
(NCBI, Expasy,...), interfaces to common and not-so-common programs
(Clustalw, DSSP, MSMS,...), a standard sequence class, various
clustering modules, a KD tree data structure etc. and even
documentation.

If you use Biopython in work contributing to a scientific publication,
please cite the application note (below) or one of the module specific
publications (listed on Biopython's website):
