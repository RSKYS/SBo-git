# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bowtie2: bowtie2 (A tool for aligning sequencing reads)
bowtie2:
bowtie2: Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning
bowtie2: sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly
bowtie2: good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of
bowtie2: characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long
bowtie2: (e.g. mammalian) genomes.
