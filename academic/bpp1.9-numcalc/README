Bio++ is a set of C++ libraries for Bioinformatics, including sequence
analysis, phylogenetics, molecular evolution and population genetics.
Bio++ is Object Oriented and is designed to be both easy to use and
computer efficient. Bio++ intends to help programmers to write
computer expensive programs, by providing them a set of re-usable
tools.

This contains the Bio++ 1.9 (April 2010) NumCalc Library. It can be
installed along the current Bio++ suite libraries, however they better
not be present at compile time.
