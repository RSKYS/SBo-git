Bio++ program suite

The Bio++ Program Suite is a package of programs using the Bio++
libraries and dedicated to Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution. All
programs are independent, but can be combined to perform rather
complex analyses. These programs use the interface helper tools of the
libraries, and hence share the same syntax. They also have several
options in common, which may also be shared by third-party software.
