# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bppsuite:
bppsuite: The Bio++ Program Suite is a package of programs using the Bio++
bppsuite: libraries and dedicated to Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution.
bppsuite: All programs are independent, but can be combined to perform
bppsuite: rather complex analyses. These programs use the interface helper
bppsuite: tools of the libraries, and hence share the same syntax. They also
bppsuite: have several options in common, which may also be shared by third-
bppsuite: party software.
