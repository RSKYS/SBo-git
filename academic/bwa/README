Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is an efficient program that aligns
relatively short nucleotide sequences against a long reference sequence
such as the human genome. It implements two algorithms, bwa-short and
BWA-SW. The former works for query sequences shorter than 200bp and the
latter for longer sequences up to around 100kbp. Both algorithms do
gapped alignment. They are usually more accurate and faster on queries
with low error rates.

A configuration file ("_aptx_configuration_file") will be used if it is
in your $HOME. An example configuration file is available in
/usr/share/archeopteryx.
