# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bwa: bwa (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner)
bwa:
bwa: Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is an efficient program that aligns
bwa: relatively short nucleotide sequences against a long reference
bwa: sequence such as the human genome. It implements two algorithms,
bwa: bwa-short and BWA-SW. The former works for query sequences shorter
bwa: than 200bp and the latter for longer sequences up to around 100kbp.
