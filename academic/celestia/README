A real-time space simulation that lets you experience our universe
in three dimensions.

There are four frontend possibilities to choose. The Glut one works out 
of the box, the GTK one needs gtkglext, and the Gnome one is untested.
The KDE frontend requires kde3 and will not work with the kde3 compat
packages, so it's essentially nonfunctional.

This requires lua, and gtkglext is optional but recommended.
