CHOLMOD is a set of ANSI C routines for sparse Cholesky factorization
and update/downdate.

This package is part of SuiteSparse.

This requires a BLAS/LAPACK implementation.  Choose one of these
package sets:
 * OpenBLAS (includes both a BLAS and a LAPACK implementation)
 * atlas (includes both a BLAS and a LAPACK implementation)
 * blas, lapack (the Netlib reference implementations)
If more than one set is installed (assuming there are no packaging
conflicts) then the auto-detection will use the first implementation
from this list that it finds.  If in doubt, choose the Netlib
reference implementations; other packages that require a BLAS or
LAPACK implementation may not build if they are not configured to
detect/use alternate implementations.

metis is an optional dependency and will be used if found.
