The cistrome refers to "the set of cis-acting targets of a trans-
acting factor on a genome-wide scale, also known as the in vivo
genome-wide location of transcription factor binding-sites or histone
modifications". The term cistrome is a portmanteau of cistron + genome
and was coined by investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
and Harvard Medical School.

This is cistrome-conductGO (GO analysis): a galaxy tool to find the
top-n highest expressed TFs. For a list of input genes, this tool uses
R/BioC packages (GO, GOstats) to identify over represented GO terms.

GO analysis depends on several R script tools (GOstats, GO.db,
hgu133a.db, hgu133b.db, hgu133plus2.db, hgu95av2.db, mouse430a2.db,
celegans.db, drosophila2.db, org.Hs.eg.db, org.Mm.eg.db, org.Ce.eg.db,
org.Dm.eg.db). Visit https://bioconductor.org/ for details and see
"biocondictor.txt" (also copied to the documentation folder of the
created package) for batch installation of the required Bioconductor
Packages.

NOTE!
This just repackages the script redistributed by the UniPro Ugene
project, part of their External Tools package. This is the reason the
homepage link points to Ugene. The source is hosted on Source Forge by
