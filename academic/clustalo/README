Clustal is a widely used, multiple sequence alignment program. This
is Clustal Omega, the latest addition to the Clustal family. It
offers a significant increase in scalability over previous versions,
allowing hundreds of thousands of sequences to be aligned in only a
few hours. In addition, the quality of alignments is superior to
previous versions, as measured by a range of popular benchmarks.

Clustal Omega is currently a command line-only tool, but the following
independent programs provide an easy to use GUI:
- seaview
- ugene
