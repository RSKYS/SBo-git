# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

copasi: copasi (tool for modeling and simulation of biochemical networks)
copasi:
copasi: COPASI is a stand-alone program that simulates models of biochemical
copasi: networks using ODE solvers or Gillespie's stochastic simulation
copasi: algorithm. COPASI is compatible with models in SBML format. It also
copasi: performs several analyses: stability, parameter sensitivity,
copasi: elementary modes, Lyapunov exponents, optimization, and parameter
copasi: estimation. Data can be visualized in plots, histograms and animations
copasi: of network diagrams. Both GUI and a command line version are included.
