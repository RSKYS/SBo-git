CryptoMiniSat SAT solver

This system provides CryptoMiniSat, an advanced SAT solver. The system
has 3 interfaces: command-line, C++ library and python. The command-line
interface takes a cnf as an input in the DIMACS format with the
extension of XOR clauses. The C++ interface mimics this except that it
allows for a more efficient system, with assumptions and multiple
solve() calls. A C compatible wrapper is also provided. The python
interface provides a high-level yet efficient API to use most of the C++
interface with ease.
