# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cryptominisat: cryptominisat (SAT solver)
cryptominisat:
cryptominisat: This system provides CryptoMiniSat, an advanced SAT solver. The system
cryptominisat: has 3 interfaces: command-line, C++ library and python. The
cryptominisat: command-line interface takes a cnf as an input in the DIMACS format
cryptominisat: with the extension of XOR clauses. The C++ interface mimics this
cryptominisat: except that it allows for a more efficient system, with assumptions
cryptominisat: and multiple solve() calls. A C compatible wrapper is also
cryptominisat: provided. The python interface provides a high-level yet efficient API
cryptominisat: to use most of the C++ interface with ease.
