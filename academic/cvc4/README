CVC4 is an automated theorem prover and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT) solver. Given a formula in first-order logic, it attempts to
either prove the formula or find a counterexample. CVC4 supports
arithmetic, reasoning about arrays, and several other built-in
theories. Input problems are written in SMT-LIB format.

This package includes the cvc4 program, libraries, and Python 2
bindings.

Note that this SlackBuild builds CVC4 with readline support, which means
the resulting executable is licensed under the GPLv3.
