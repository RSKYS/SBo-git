  dimod is a shared API for samplers. It provides:

  - classes for quadratic models---such as the binary quadratic model
    (BQM) class that contains Ising and QUBO models used by samplers
    such as the D-Wave system---and higher-order (non-quadratic)
    models.
  - reference examples of samplers and composed samplers.
  - abstract base classes for constructing new samplers and composed
    samplers.


  If you want to run the tests set the environment variable TESTS=yes.
