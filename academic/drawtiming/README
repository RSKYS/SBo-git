DrawTiming provides a command line tool for documenting hardware and
software designs through timing diagrams.  It reads signal descriptions
from a text file with an intuitive syntax, and outputs a timing diagram
to an image file. Notation typical of timing diagrams found in the
Electrical Engineering discipline is used, including arrows
indicating causal relationships between signal transitions.
