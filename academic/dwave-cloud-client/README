  A minimal implementation of the REST interface used to communicate
with D-Wave Solver API (SAPI) servers.

  SAPI is an application layer built to provide resource discovery,
permissions, and scheduling for quantum annealing resources at
D-Wave Systems. This package provides a minimal Python interface to
that layer without compromising the quality of interactions and
workflow.
