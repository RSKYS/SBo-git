# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dwave-greedy:
dwave-greedy:   An implementation of a steepest descent solver for binary
dwave-greedy: quadratic models.
dwave-greedy:   Steepest descent is the discrete analogue of gradient descent,
dwave-greedy: but the best move is computed using a local minimization rather
dwave-greedy: rather than computing a gradient. At each step, we determine the
dwave-greedy: dimension along which to descend based on the highest energy drop
