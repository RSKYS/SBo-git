# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dwave-neal:   An implementation of a simulated annealing sampler.
dwave-neal:
dwave-neal:   A simulated annealing sampler can be used for approximate Boltzmann
dwave-neal: sampling or heuristic optimization. This implementation approaches
