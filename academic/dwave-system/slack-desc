# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dwave-system: dwave-system (basic API for D-Wave system)
dwave-system:
dwave-system:   dwave-system is a basic API for easily incorporating the D-Wave
dwave-system: system as a sampler in the D-Wave Ocean software stack, directly or
dwave-system: through Leap's cloud-based hybrid solvers. It includes DWaveSampler,
dwave-system: a dimod sampler that accepts and passes system parameters such as
dwave-system: system identification and authentication down the stack,
dwave-system: LeapHybridSampler, for Leap's hybrid solvers, and other. It also
dwave-system: includes several useful composites---layers of pre- and 
dwave-system: post-processing---that can be used with DWaveSampler to handle
dwave-system: minor-embedding, optimize chain strength, etc.
