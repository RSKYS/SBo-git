Engauge digitizing software converts an image file showing a graph or
map, into numbers. The image file can come from a scanner, digital
camera or screenshot. The numbers can be read on the screen, and
written or copied to a spreadsheet. Engauge Digitizer compensates for
rotation, scaling and skew (also known as shearing) in graphs. Engauge
recognizes BMP, CUR, DDS, GIF, ICNS, ICO, JP2, JPG, MNG, PBM, PDF,
PGM, PNG, PPM, SVG, SVGZ, TGA, TIFF, WBMP, WEBP, XBM and XPM image
files.
