# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ent: ent (pseudorandom number sequence test program)
ent:
ent: ent applies various tests to sequences of bytes stored in files
ent: and reports the results of those tests. The program is useful
ent: for evaluating pseudorandom number generators for encryption and
ent: statistical sampling applications, compression algorithms, and other
ent: applications where the information density of a file is of interest.
ent: Tests performed include Entropy, Chi-square, Arithmetic Mean, Monte
ent: Carlo value for Pi, and Serial Correlation Coefficient.
