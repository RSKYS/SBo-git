Ephem is a program that displays ephemerides for all the planets plus
any two additional objects.  The additional objects may be fixed or
specified via heliocentric elliptical, hyperbolic or parabolic orbital
elements to accommodate solar system objects such as asteroids or
comets.

The user manual can be found at /usr/share/doc/ephem-4.32/Man.txt.
