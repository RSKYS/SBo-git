FinchTV - A Brilliant Trace Viewer

FinchTV developed by Geospiza (acquired later by PerkinELmer) is the
popular way to view DNA sequence traces. FinchTV started as the only
chromatogram viewer that can display an entire trace in a scalable
multi-pane view. And it leads the way with raw data views, BLAST
searching and the ability to reverse complement sequences and traces.

This is just repackaging of the ready i386 binary. It WILL work on a
stock Slackware64 as well (no multilib needed).

NOTE!
FinchTV has entered the End of Life phase, effective December 6, 2016
and PerkinElmer will no longer provide support for FinchTV. The Linux
version is, in fact, over 10 years old. However, it offers a statically
linked executable that just works. The tarball, formerly provided by
upstream, is now hosted by the SlackBuild maintainer.
