# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

finchtv: Geospiza's FinchTV is the popular way to view DNA sequence traces.
finchtv: FinchTV started as the only chromatogram viewer that can display
finchtv: an entire trace in a scalable multi-pane view. And it leads the
finchtv: way with raw data views, BLAST searching and the ability to reverse
finchtv: complement sequences and traces.
