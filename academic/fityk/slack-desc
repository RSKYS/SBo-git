# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fityk: fityk (program for data processing and nonlinear curve fitting)
fityk:
fityk: Fityk is a program for data processing and nonlinear curve fitting.
fityk: Primarily used:
fityk: - by scientists who analyze data from powder diffraction,
fityk: chromatography, photoluminescence and photoelectron spectroscopy,
fityk: infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and other experimental techniques;
fityk: - to fit peaks -- bell-shaped functions (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt,
fityk: Pearson VII, bifurcated Gaussian, EMG, Doniach-Sunjic, etc.);
fityk: but it is suitable for fitting any curve to 2D (x,y) data.
