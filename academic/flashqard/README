FlashQard is an educational software to improve your learning process.  
It is designed to help you learn not only a new language but anything 
that can be learned!  This aim is achieved by using the widely used 
method called the Leitner System and the idea of "different card types 
for different purposes".  Leitner System (proposed by Sebastian Leitner 
in the 1970s) is one the most efficient methods for learning, which 
allows you to focus on the most difficult flashcards and not waste your 
time on what you have already learned.
