The program Flexbar preprocesses high-throughput sequencing data 
efficiently. It demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter 
sequences. Moreover, trimming and filtering features are provided. 
Flexbar increases read mapping rates and improves genome as well as 
transcriptome assemblies. It supports next-generation sequencing data 
in fasta and fastq format, e.g. from Roche 454 and the Illumina 
platform.

The script downloads the segan-library needed for compilation.
