# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

flexbar: flexbar (barcode and adapter removal)
flexbar:
flexbar: The program Flexbar preprocesses high-throughput sequencing data
flexbar: efficiently. It demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter
flexbar: sequences. Moreover, trimming and filtering features are provided.
flexbar: Flexbar increases read mapping rates and improves genome as well as
flexbar: transcriptome assemblies. It supports next-generation sequencing data
flexbar: in fasta and fastq format, e.g. from Roche 454 and the Illumina
flexbar: platform.
