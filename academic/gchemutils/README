The Gnome Chemistry Utils (gchemutils) is a collection of libraries,
programs and plugins that are useful for chemists and science students.

Six programs are available:
1) A 2D chemical editor (GChemPaint)
2) A 3D molecular structure viewer (GChem3Viewer)
3) A Crystal structure viewer (GCrystal)
4) A Chemical calculator (GChemCalc)
5) A Spectrum viewer (GSpectrum)
6) A periodic table of the elements application (GChemTable)

Three plugins for external programs are included:
1) A GOffice plugin allows embedding GChemPaint supported files in
   programs supporting the GOffice component framework
2) A Gnumeric plugin provides a molar mass function for the spreadsheet
3) A Mozilla plugin allows embedding 2D, 3D and crystal structures as
   well as spectra in web pages

An optional build-time dependency is gnumeric for building its plugin.

NOTES: The Mozilla plugin might not be very stable, so if you want
to prevent it from building, pass MOZILLA=NO to the script.
