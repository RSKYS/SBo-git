gElemental is a periodic table viewer that provides detailed info
on the chemical elements. It is a port of GPeriodic to C++ and gtkmm.
It offers an improved UI, an updated and corrected data set, a better
data format, a list view and easier coloration. The Chemical data are
largely derived from BODR (the Blue Obelisk Data Repository) and from
the chemical data compilations on the English Wikipedia.
