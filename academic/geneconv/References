HOW TO CITE GENECONV  (table of contents)

A paper describing GENECONV has not yet appeared. In the meantime, try

S. A. Sawyer (1999) GENECONV: A computer package for the statistical detection of gene conversion. Distributed by the author, Department of Mathematics, Washington University in St. Louis, available at http://www.math.wustl.edu/~sawyer.

The reference

Sawyer, S. A. (1989) Statistical tests for detecting gene conversion. Molecular Biology and Evolution 6, 526-538.

is out of date for GENECONV, but could be used instead if journal policies only allow references to printed publications.
