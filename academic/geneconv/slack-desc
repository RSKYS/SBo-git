# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

geneconv: geneconv (Statistical Tests for Detecting Gene Conversion)
geneconv:
geneconv: Given an alignment of DNA or protein sequences, GENECONV finds
geneconv: the most likely candidates for aligned gene conversion events
geneconv: between pairs of sequences in the alignment. The program can also
geneconv: look for gene conversion events from outside of the alignment.
geneconv: Candidate events are ranked by multiple-comparison corrected P-
geneconv: values and listed to a spreadsheet-like output file.
