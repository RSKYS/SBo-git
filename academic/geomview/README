Geomview is an interactive 3D viewing program for Unix.

Geomview lets you view and manipulate three-dimensional objects: you
use the mouse to rotate, translate, zoom in and out, and so on.
Geomview can be used as a standalone viewer for static objects (it
supports a variety of file formats) or as a display engine for other
programs which produce dynamically changing geometry.

This slackBuild uses the configure option --with-opengl.
