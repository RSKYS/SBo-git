GetDP (A General Environment for the Treatment of Discrete Problems)

GetDP is a free finite element solver using mixed elements
to discretize de Rham-type complexes in one, two and three
dimensions. The main feature of GetDP is the closeness between
the input data defining discrete problems (written by the user in
ASCII data files) and the symbolic mathematical expressions of these
problems.

Optional dependency: gmsh

Note:
If you want to build Getdp with Gmsh support it is necessary to
install the Gmsh package first, but compiled with both static and
dynamic libraries. If you use the build script for Gmsh available at
SBo you just need to pass:
BUILDSTATICLIB=yes
prior to run gmsh.SlackBuild
