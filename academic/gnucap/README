Gnucap is a modern "post-spice" analog and mixed signal circuit
simulator.  Gnucap is designed so it can eventually replace
Spice. Today, it can replace Spice in some applications. There are
some significant technical advantages. It is a work in progress. New
features are added regularly as time and demand permits.
