Gpredict is a real-time satellite tracking and orbit prediction
application. It can track an unlimited number of satellites and
display their position and other data in lists, tables, maps, and
polar plots (radar view). Gpredict can also predict the time of
future.

Gpredict is different from other satellite tracking programs
in that it allows you to group the satellites into visualisation
modules. Each of these modules can be configured independently
from the others giving you unlimited flexibility concerning the
look and feel of the modules. Naturally, Gpredict will also
allow you to track satellites relatively to different observer
locations - at the same time.
