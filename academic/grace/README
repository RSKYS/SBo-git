Grace is a WYSIWYG tool to make two-dimensional plots of numerical
data. It runs under various (if not all) flavors of Unix with X11 and
M*tif (LessTif or Motif). It also runs under VMS, OS/2, and Windows
(95/98/NT/2000/XP). Its capabilities are roughly similar to GUI-based
programs like Sigmaplot or Microcal Origin plus script-based tools like
Gnuplot or Genplot. Its strength lies in the fact that it combines the
convenience of a graphical user interface with the power of a scripting
language which enables it to do sophisticated calculations or perform
automated tasks.

Grace is derived from Xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr), originally written by Paul
Turner.
