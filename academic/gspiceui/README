The name gSpiceUI is an abbreviation of the project title GNU SPICE GUI,
which is itself an acronym standing for Gnu is Not Unix, Simulation
Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis, Graphical User Interface.

gSpiceUI is intended to provide a GUI for freely available electronic
circuit simulation engines ie. NG-Spice and GNU-Cap. The utility
gnetlist is used to convert schematic files to netlist files,
Gwave or Gaw to display simulation results and Gschem is the
preferred schematic capture tool.gSpiceUI is useless without the
software tools it depends on.
