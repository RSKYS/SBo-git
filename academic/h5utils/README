h5utils (visualization and conversion of HDF5 data)

H5utils is is a set of utilities for visualization and conversion of
scientific data in the free, portable HDF5 format.  Besides providing
a simple tool for batch visualization as PNG images, h5utils also
includes programs to convert HDF5 datasets into the formats required
by other free visualization software (e.g. plain text, Vis5d, and
VTK).

This package requires: hdf5

You probably want to preinstall: libmatheval

You possibly want to install: octave, hdf; and perhaps Vis5d (not on
SBo).


Configuration:

You can add additional options to the command line using the
environment variable SBOPTIONS_H5UTILS; e.g. to enable the hdf4 utils
and not rely on the conversion routines, use

SBOPTIONS_H5UTILS="--with-hdf4" ./h5utils.Slackbuild

Alternatively, if building non-interactively (e.g. if using slpkg),
use/create the file /etc/sbo_pkg_options.conf since this slackbuild
script will search it for options. Simply include a line starting
"h5utils:" followed by options, e.g.:

h5utils: --with-hdf4
