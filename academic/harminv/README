harminv (harmonic inversion from a time series)

Harminv is a program and library that solves the problem of 
harmonic inversion. It takes a discrete-time, finite-length 
signal, and decomposes it into a sum of finitely-many 
sinusoids, determining the frequencies, decay constants, 
amplitudes, and phases of those sinusoids.

This package requires: lapack

If the build script can find the ATLAS libraries, it will
adapt the configure options to use them rather than the 
default lapack.
