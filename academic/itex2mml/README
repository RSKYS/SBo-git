itexToMML (Program to convert inline TeX to MathML)

itexToMML takes input containing inline TeX math markup and
generates equivalent output with the math replaced by MathML. It
also includes Ruby bindings by default, which may be useful for
users of Instiki (www.instiki.org); set the environment variable
RUBY=no to disable this.
