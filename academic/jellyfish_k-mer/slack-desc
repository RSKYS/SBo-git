# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jellyfish_k-mer: jellyfish_k-mer (A tool for counting of k-mers in DNA)
jellyfish_k-mer:
jellyfish_k-mer: Jellyfish is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers
jellyfish_k-mer: in DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the
jellyfish_k-mer: occurrences of all such substrings is a central step in many
jellyfish_k-mer: analyses of DNA sequence. Jellyfish can count k-mers quickly by
jellyfish_k-mer: using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by exploiting the
jellyfish_k-mer: "compare-and-swap" CPU instruction to increase parallelism.
