LAPACKE provides a native C interface to LAPACK routines available at
www.netlib.org/lapack to facilitate usage of LAPACK functionality for
C programmers.

This package is intended for use with the Netlib reference LAPACK.
It should also work with other LAPACK implementations that do not
already provide a LAPACKE implementation.

xblas is an optional dependency.

To build a static library in addition to the shared library, pass
STATIC=yes to the script.
