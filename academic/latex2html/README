LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features 
designed for the production of technical and scientific
documentation. Latex2html is used for converting Latex files which
have a .tex suffix to html

a basic latex document looks like this:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
  Hello World!
\end{document}

if you save such a document say called helloworld.tex
then to convert this document to  html form, open a terminal
and cd to where  helloworld.tex is.

Then its a simple as
$latex2html helloworld.tex

for option flags type: $latex2html --help

for extensive documentation see manual.pdf

when package is installed a copy of manual.pdf
will be put in /usr/doc/latex2html-2019.2
