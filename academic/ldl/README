LDL is a set of concise routines for factorizing symmetric
positive-definite sparse matrices, with some applicability to symmetric
indefinite matrices.  Its primary purpose is to illustrate much of
the basic theory of sparse matrix algorithms in as concise a code
as possible, including an elegant new method of sparse symmetric
factorization that computes the factorization row-by-row but stores it
column-by-column.

This package is part of SuiteSparse.

AMD is an optional dependency and will be used if found.  It is
primarily used for this package's test suite.
