# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

link-grammar: link-grammar (syntactic parser of English)
link-grammar:
link-grammar: The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, based
link-grammar: on link grammar, an original theory of English syntax. Given a
link-grammar: sentence, the system assigns to it a syntactic structure, which
link-grammar: consists of a set of labeled links connecting pairs of words.
link-grammar: The parser also produces a "constituent" (Penn tree-bank style
link-grammar: phrase tree) representation of a sentence (showing noun phrases,
link-grammar: verb phrases, etcetera).
