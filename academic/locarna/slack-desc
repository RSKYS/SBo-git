# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

locarna: locarna (Local RNA alignment on structural basis)
locarna:
locarna: LocARNA is a collection of alignment tools for the structural 
locarna: analysis of RNA. Given a set of RNA sequences, LocARNA simultaneously 
locarna: aligns and predicts common structures for your RNAs. In this way, 
locarna: LocARNA performs Sankoff-like alignment and is in particular suited 
locarna: for analyzing sets of related RNAs without known common structure.
