It is a good practice to run the series of tests provided by the MEME
Suite developers once the executables are built. Unfortunatelly, they
cannot be run properly as root (at least here).

You can, however, run them once the package is built as a normal user.
Just copy the folder where the meme suite was built as your normal user,
navigate there and run 'make test'. So, do something like this (for meme
version 5.1.0):

1) cp -a /tmp/SBo/meme-5.1.0/ ~/
2) cd ~/meme-5.1.0
3) make test

You should receive a summary, like this:

========================================================================
Testsuite summary for meme 5.1.0
========================================================================
# TOTAL: 152
# PASS:  152
# SKIP:  0
# XFAIL: 0
# FAIL:  0
# XPASS: 0
# ERROR: 0
========================================================================

Note that on my 32bit installation of Slackware in a VM, the tests fail.
