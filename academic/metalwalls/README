  MetalWalls (MW) is a molecular dynamics code dedicated to the
modelling of electrochemical systems. Its main originality is the
inclusion of a series of methods allowing to apply a constant
potential within the electrode materials.

  For building the MPI version set the environment variable MPI=yes
this requires a MPI implementation either openmpi or mpich.

  The final executable is metalwalls
