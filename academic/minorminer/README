  minorminer is a heuristic tool for minor embedding: given a minor
and target graph, it tries to find a mapping that embeds the minor
into the target.
  minorminer is a tool for finding graph minors, developed to embed
Ising problems onto quantum annealers (QA). Where it can be used to
find minors in arbitrary graphs, it is particularly geared towards
the state of the art in QA: problem graphs of a few to a few hundred
variables, and hardware graphs of a few thousand qubits.


  Optional building mode set with environment variables:
  - TESTS=yes (performs tests, requires gtest)
