mpb (computes electromagnetic band structures and modes)

MPB is a free and open-source software package for computing
electromagnetic band structures and modes. It saves results in hdf5
format.

This package requires: hdf5, libctl, lapack

You may wish to also install: h5utils

You very probably want to build a multi-processor version of this
code by adding the "--with-openmp" configure option.

Configuration:

If the build script can find the ATLAS libraries, it will adapt the
configure options to use them rather than the default lapack.

You can add additional options to the command line using
the environment variable SBOPTIONS_MPB; e.g. to enable MPI
(multi-processor calculation) using openmp, use:

SBOPTIONS_MPB="--with-openmp" ./mpb.Slackbuild

Alternatively, if building non-interactively (e.g. if using slpkg),
use/create the file /etc/sbo_pkg_options.conf since this slackbuild
script will search it for options. Simply include a line starting
"mpb:" followed by options, e.g.:

mpb: --with-openmp

If you want to use mpich instead of openmp, you will have to recompile
the installed slackware fftw library with two additional configure
options, i.e.  not only "--with-mpi" but also "--enable-type-prefix".

Note:

This mpb build script does *two* passes. This is so that when
MPI support is enabled, the first compiles the mpb-data utility,
then the second builds the full MPI version. The resulting package
includes both, with any MPI version of the files replacing the non-
MPI version.
