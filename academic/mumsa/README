Mumsa is a tool for automatic assessment of alignment quality. A number
of alternate (to be compared) multiple alignments have to be generated
and submitted. 

Mumsa computes:
- the average overlap score (AOS), reflecting the difficulty of aligning
  the sequences
- multiple overlap score (MOS) indicating the quality of each individual
  alignment. 

Both scores range between one and zero.
