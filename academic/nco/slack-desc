# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nco: The NCO toolkit manipulates and analyzes data stored in netCDF-
nco: accessible formats, including DAP, HDF4, and HDF5. It exploits the
nco: geophysical expressivity of many CF (Climate & Forecast) metadata
nco: conventions, the flexible description of physical dimensions
nco: translated by UDUnits, the network transparency of OPeNDAP, the
nco: storage features (e.g., compression, chunking, groups) of HDF (the
