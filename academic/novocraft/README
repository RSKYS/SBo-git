Novoalign is a powerful tool designed for mapping of short reads onto a
reference genome from Illumina, Ion Torrent, and 454 NGS platforms.

It comes as part of a suit of programs (novocraft).

This is a repackaging of the binaries made available by Novocraft that
do not need a license.

IMPORTANT

Because of restrictions at the Novocraft website you can not download
the package directly. You must go via the main download page.
