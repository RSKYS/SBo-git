# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pal2nal: pal2nal (Create a codon-based DNA alignment)
pal2nal:
pal2nal: PAL2NAL is a program that converts a multiple sequence alignment
pal2nal: of proteins and the corresponding DNA (or mRNA) sequences into
pal2nal: a codon-based DNA alignment. The resulting codon-based DNA
pal2nal: alignment can further be subjected to the calculation of
pal2nal: synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution rates.
