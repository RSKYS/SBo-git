(especially working with multiple bases) that are hard work without
this or another programmer's calculator. Main features:

o Full math parser, parentheses, add, sub, mult, div, exponential
o Automatic conversion between HEX DEC OCT BIN numbers
o Mixing different bases in one expression
o Definable variables
o Math constants (E PI ...)
o Built in math functions (sin/cos/sqrt ...)
