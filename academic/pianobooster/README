pianobooster (educational music software)

PianoBooster is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment
and at the same time learning the basics of reading musical
notation. The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard
midi file is that PianoBooster listens and follows what you are playing
on a midi piano keyboard.
