Primer3 is a widely used program for designing PCR primers (PCR =
"Polymerase Chain Reaction"). PCR is an essential and ubiquitous tool
in genetics and molecular biology. Primer3 can design hybridization
probes and sequencing primers.

PCR is used for many different goals. Consequently, primer3 has many
different input parameters that you control and that tell primer3
exactly what characteristics make good primers for your goals.
