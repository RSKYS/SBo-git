To test the pyCRAC scripts after installing the package on Slackware:

  cp -R /usr/share/pyCRAC-$VERSION <path-to-your-work-directory>/
  cd <path-to-your-work-directory>/pyCRAC-$VERSION/tests
  sh test.sh

If all tests complete without an error, the package is working.

In case of any problems please email the SBo maintainer of pyCRAC
