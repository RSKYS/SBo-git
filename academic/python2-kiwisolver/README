This is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
solving algorithm. Kiwi(solver) is based on the seminal Cassowary
paper. It is not a refactoring of the original C++ solver, but has been
designed from the ground up to be lightweight and fast. It ranges from
10x to 500x faster than the original Cassowary solver with typical use
cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings are consistently > 5x.

Version 1.1.0 is the last one with support for python2.
