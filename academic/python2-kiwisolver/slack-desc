# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python2-kiwisolver:
python2-kiwisolver: This is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
python2-kiwisolver: solving algorithm. Kiwi(solver) is based on the seminal Cassowary
python2-kiwisolver: paper. It is not a refactoring of the original C++ solver, but has
