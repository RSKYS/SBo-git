# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

qucs-s: qucs-s (circuit simulator)
qucs-s:
qucs-s: Qucs-S is a spin-off of the Qucs circuit simulator. The "S" letter
qucs-s: indicates SPICE. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of
qucs-s: the Qucs GUI. Qucs-S is not a simulator by itself, but it requires to
qucs-s: use a simulation backend with it. The schematic document format of
qucs-s: Qucs and Qucs-S are fully compatible. These backends are supported:
qucs-s:
qucs-s: Ngspice(recommended, available on SBo), XYCE and SpiceOpus.
