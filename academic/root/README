ROOT - A data analysis framework.

ROOT is a data analysis framework used mostly, but not limited to,
high energy physics. It was written in C++ by the techs at CERN to
explore the benefits of object oriented programming in physics data 
analysis. It consists of libraries, CINT or cling interpreter for
C/C++, plotting interface and powerful parellel processing support.
It is the preferred choice in many laboratories.

It comes with A LOT of different options for compilation. And it
seems impossible to stress all of them in this one script. Therefore
the potential user is strongly advised to check the configure
script.

For mathmore support, run the SlackBuild script with MATHMORE=yes, and
for QT support, run the SlackBuild script with QT=yes, for example

  MATHMORE=yes ./root.SlackBuild

Compilation takes quite a while.
