Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages
into a common Python-based interface.

Sage can be used in several ways: through an interactive command line,
by writing stand-alone scripts, through the graphical notebook
interface in a browser, or through the KDE Cantor application (part
of a full Slackware installation).

This SlackBuild repackages an already-built binary package which
exceeds 1.5GB in size, and the resulting Slackware package uses >5GB
disk space.

To upgrade from the previous source-built Sage package from SBo, use
the upgradepkg command like this:

  upgradepkg sage%sage-bin-8.3-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz

After installing or upgrading, you will need to logout or reboot so
that sage is found in your path.

Sage's default colour scheme is for a terminal with a light background.
For a dark backgrounded terminal you may prefer the scheme after
issuing:

  mkdir -p ~/.sage; echo "%colors Linux" >> ~/.sage/init.sage

For 32-bit i686, the most recent binary package is version 8.2. You can
download sage-8.2-Debian_GNU_Linux_8-i686.tar.bz2 and then use this
SlackBuild as follows:

  VERSION=8.2 DEBVERSION=8 ARCH=i686 ./sage-bin.SlackBuild
