Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages
into a common Python-based interface.
Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma,
 Maple, Mathematica and Matlab.

Sage can be used in several ways: through an interactive command line,
by writing stand-alone scripts, through the graphical notebook
interface in a browser, or through the KDE Cantor application (part
of a full Slackware installation).

Building sage requires >12GB of disk space, so you may need to
redefine $TMP and/or $OUTPUT.
Note that the build will likely spit out many "zero length file" errors,
which can safely be ignored.

See README.BUILDOPTS for additional (important) information
about build options and such. Specifically, if you do not move the
installation directory via a specification of SAGEROOT, you may need
to do something like

source /etc/profile.d/sage.ch

so make sure the binary is in your path.

This package does not include the doc files. Those can be found at
doc.sagemath.org.

NOTE: If you have ATOM processors, you need to run this command prior
building: export OPENBLAS_CONFIGURE="TARGET=ATOM"
