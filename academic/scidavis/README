SciDAVis (data analysis and visualization)

SciDAVis is a free interactive application aimed at data analysis and
publication-quality plotting. It combines a shallow learning curve and
an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface with powerful
features such as scriptability and extensibility.

SciDAVis started as a fork of QtiPlot.

Optional dependencies at runtime are scipy and pygsl (to improve
python scripting)
