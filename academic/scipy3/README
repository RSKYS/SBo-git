SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
science, and engineering.

The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many
user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for
numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular
operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of charge. NumPy
and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended upon by
some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.

matplotlib and ipython are nice to have in connection with scipy, but scipy
does not depend on them.

Since ver. 0.14.0 scipy uses SuperLU instead of UMFPACK for solving unsymmetric
sparse linear systems. If you want to use UMFPACK you must install it in advance
of numpy and build numpy accordingly (see the README to numpy's SlackBuild).
Moreover, after installing scipy, you have to install scikit-umfpack, which
presently is not available on SlackBuilds.org.

If you need to build scipy for debugging, set DEBUG=y.

NOTE: If you use this SlackBuild scipy will run with the python 3 version
      installed on your system. If you'd like to use python 2.7.xx as
      provided by Slackware Linux then you have to install it with the scipy
      SlackBuild.
