sigrok-cli is a command-line frontend for sigrok.

It cannot display graphical output, but is still sufficient to run
through the whole process of hardware initialization, acquisition,
protocol decoding and saving the session.

It is useful for running on remote or embedded systems, netbooks, PDAs,
and for various other use-cases. It can display samples on standard
output or save them in various file formats.

Optional dependency (available from SlackBuilds.org):
- libsigrokdecode.
