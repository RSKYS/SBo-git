SIM - Local similarity program

SIM finds k best non-intersecting alignments between two sequences or
within a sequence using dynamic programming techniques. The alignments
are reported in order of decreasing similarity score and share no
aligned pairs.

Once the alignment is computed, you can view it using "lalnview", a
graphical viewer program for pairwise alignments, available at SBo.
