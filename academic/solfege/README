Notes:

1. If you don't hear any audio, you may have to edit the ~/.solfegerc
   file and add "-Os -o hw:0" to the midi_player_options.
   Mine looks like:

     midi_player_options=-Os -o hw:0 -idqq %s

   I don't see a way to make this change via the GUI.

2. Although freepats is listed as required in the .info file, this
   will work with eawpats instead.
