SPICE OPUS is a circuit simulation program  with optimisation
utilities. It is a recompilation of the original Berkeley's
source code for Windows 95/98/NT and Linux operating systems with
Georgia Tech Research Institute's XSpice mixed-mode simulator.
The simulator includes an interpreted programming language
called Nutmeg, which allows interactive Spice sessions.
