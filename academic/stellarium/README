Stellarium shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the
naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.  It is being used in planetarium
projectors. Just set your coordinates and go.

For reasonable performance, you will want to have some kind of 3D
acceleration.

gpsd is an optional dependency for enabling location detection through
a GPS device.
