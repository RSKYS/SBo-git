stellarsolver Astrometric Plate Solver

stellarsolver is a cross platform SEP-based star extractor and         
astrometry.net-based internal astrometric solver. Also refered to as
Plate solving or Astrometric calibration of an astronomical image,
this is a technique used in astronomy and applied on celestial images.
the astrometric solution it is possible to calculate the celestial
coordinates of any object on the image or synchronize the telescope
