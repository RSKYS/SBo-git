SUNDIALS was implemented with the goal of providing robust time
integrators and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated
into existing simulation codes. The primary design goals were to
require minimal information from the user, allow users to easily
supply their own data structures underneath the solvers, and allow
for easy incorporation of user-supplied linear solvers and
preconditioners.

Optional dependencies: blas, lapack, suitesparse
