# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sundials: sundials (Equation Solvers)
sundials:
sundials: SUNDIALS was implemented with the goal of providing robust time
sundials: integrators and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated
sundials: into existing simulation codes. The primary design goals were to
sundials: require minimal information from the user, allow users to easily
sundials: supply their own data structures underneath the solvers, and allow
sundials: for easy incorporation of user-supplied linear solvers and
sundials: preconditioners.
