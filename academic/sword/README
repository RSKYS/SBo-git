The SWORD Project is an effort to create an ever expanding software
package for research and study of God and His Word.  The SWORD Bible
Framework allows easy manipulation of Bible texts, commentaries,
lexicons,dictionaries, etc.
Many frontends are build using this framework. An installed module set
may be shared between any frontend using the framework.

This engine/library needs data to operate on to be usefull.

A sword-data-kjv package is available on sbo to provide a basic bible
with strongs and Greek and Hebrew dictionaries for use with this
library. Many more bibles, commentries etc. can be found on the
crosswire.org website.

modules can be downloaded in raw format (zip) and extracted into the
/usr/share/sword  directory.

You will also need a frontend, such as xiphos or bibletime (both on sbo)
to view the bible data.
