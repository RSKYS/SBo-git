Tabix indexes a TAB-delimited genome position file in.tab.bgz and
creates an index file in.tab.bgz.tbi when region is absent from the
command-line. The input data file must be position sorted and
compressed by bgzip which has a gzip like interface. After indexing,
tabix is able to quickly retrieve data lines overlapping regions
specified in the format "chr:beginPos-endPos". Fast data retrieval
also works over network if URI is given as a file name and in this
case the index file will be downloaded if it is not present locally.

NOTE!
Tabix is now included in htslib. This is an older version of the
program, kept here for compatibility with Ugene. You can safely install
it along htslib. When you start Ugene, go to Settings > Preferences >
External Tools and manually select the legacy binary in /usr/bin/
