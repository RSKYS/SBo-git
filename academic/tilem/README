An emulator for the Z80 series of Texas Instruments graphing 
calculators. It emulates all current Z80 calculator models 
except the TI-81, and features a debugger, external file 
loading, and full flash support, including flash app loading. 

Tilem requires no additional dependencies other than GTK, but
does require a rom from one of the supported calculators to
function.

This package can live alongside TiLem2, but building will
fail if libticables2 is installed. If you want libticables2
support, use TiLem2, or build TiLem before building
libticables2.
