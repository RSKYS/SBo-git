An emulator for the Z80 series of Texas Instruments graphing 
calculators. It emulates all current Z80 calculator models 
including the TI-81, and features a debugger, external file 
loading, and full flash support, including flash app loading. 

TiLem2 is a major step forward from previous versions, and
so can be installed alongside a 0.97x version. It will not
touch or use your current ~/.TilEm directory.

TiLem2 requires a ROM for your calculator.
