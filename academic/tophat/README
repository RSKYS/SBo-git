TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns
RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput
short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to
identify splice junctions between exons.

TopHat is a collaborative effort between the Institute of Genetic
Medicine at Johns Hopkins University, the Departments of Mathematics
and Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California,
Berkeley and the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at
Harvard University.

A recommended dependency is bowtie2.
