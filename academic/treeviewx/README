Rod Page's TreeView X is a simple program for displaying phylogenies.
Some of its features include:

- reads many different tree file formats (including NEXUS, PHYLIP,
  Hennig86, NONA, MEGA, and ClustalW/X)
- supports standard the TrueType and Postscript fonts
- supports native graphics file format for copying pictures into
  other applications, and for saving graphics files
- print preview
- can print multiple trees per page and/or one tree over more than
  one page
- has drag-and-drop facility for easy opening of files
- Web-based online help
- tree editor

Note!
This program is different from Michael Eisen's TreeView for matrix-
like display of expression data. Also, we build the sources distributed
by Debian.
