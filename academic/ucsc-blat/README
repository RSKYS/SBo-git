BLAT is a bioinformatics software tool which performs rapid mRNA/DNA
and cross-species protein alignments. BLAT is more accurate and 500
times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and
50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings
typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences.
