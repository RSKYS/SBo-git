The Units program converts quantities expressed in various scales
to their equivalents in other scales. The units program can handle
multiplicative scale changes as well as nonlinear conversions such
as Fahrenheit to Celsius or wire gauge. Units comes with an
annotated, extendable database defining over two thousand units.
The units are defined in an external data file.
