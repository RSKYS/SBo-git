VCFtools is a program package designed for working with VCF files,
such as those generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. The aim of
VCFtools is to provide methods for working with VCF files: validating,
merging, comparing and calculate some basic population genetic
statistics.

VCFtools supports the VCF format v4.0. The vcf-validator, Perl API and
scripts now support also VCF format v4.2 and maintain backward
compatibility with older versions.
