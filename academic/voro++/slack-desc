# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

voro++: voro++ (A 3D Voronoi cell software library)
voro++:
voro++:   Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional
voro++: computations of the Voronoi tessellation. A distinguishing feature of
voro++: the Voro++ library is that it carries out cell-based calculations,
voro++: computing the Voronoi cell for each particle individually. It is
voro++: particularly well-suited for applications that rely on cell-based
voro++: statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg. volume, centroid,
voro++: number of faces) can be used to analyze a system of particles.
