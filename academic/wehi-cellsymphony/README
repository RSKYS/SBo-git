The Cellular Symphony is an audio representation of flow cytometric
data. Each cell is represented by musical notes of timbre, pitch and
volume dependent on its FCM parameters. The program correlates the
audio output with 2D and 3D graphical display. 

It may be that only a musical savant can detect the intricacies in a
3-instrument cellular symphony or it may be that the average
cytometrist also can do so with practice.
