Flow cytometry De-Identifier

Where flow cytometry data files from the clinic are to be used in
research projects, DeID is used to remove patient identification. This
is achieved by writing a copy of the data file with selected keyword
values removed.  

DeID has been revised (July 2013) to enable processing of multi-block
data files.
