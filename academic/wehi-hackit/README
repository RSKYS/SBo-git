Where it is feared that a flow cytometry data file has been violated,
for example at the start of the file by cells carried over from the
previous sample, or at the end of the file by a nozzle blockage,
Hackit (wehi-hackit) can be used to clip the offending stream of cells
from the file. It may be used also to concatenate the data from a
number of files.
