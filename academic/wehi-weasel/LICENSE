Acquire a Weasel License

Following your free 30 day trial, continued use of Weasel requires a
small license fee, the proceeds from which are used to support further
development. This is not an annual fee but is payable once only for
permanent use of the current version. As an added bonus, free version
upgrades are offered from time to time. Furthermore, with every license
comes a free copy of the ACluE cluster analysis program. 

A single Weasel license for one computer type (e.g. Macintosh) is
valid for installation on 4 computers. A dual license is also available
that is valid for installation on 8 computers of any mix of types. 

Weasel licenses may be purchased by filling in and posting a paper
application form with accompanying cheque. Licenses may also be
purchased on-line from this page:

Please be aware that return of your license code is a manual operation
and will not occur immediately.

purchase, please contact the author.
