WEASEL: Walter & Eliza Analysis Software: Eclectic & Lucid*

WEASEL is a general purpose flow cytometry data analysis and display
program developed at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical
Research (WEHI). Many different display formats are possible as are
the extraction of a number of numerical or statistical measures.
Multiple flow cytometry standard (FCS) data files can be compared
side-by-side on screen and there is facility for fast scanning through
collections of data files. Display layouts may be saved as may high
quality graphics which may be incorporated into other documents. One
of the program's design parameters was to make operation as simple and
intuitive as possible so self instruction should be the best course.

Features:
- Common display forms (histograms, contour plots and dot plots).
- More exotic forms (3D dot plots, population linked displays, pseudo-
  imaging and biplots).
- Batch mode processing.
- Merging and exporting FCS data files.
- Export of high resolution graphics.
- Numerical statistics.
- Handles multi-block data.
