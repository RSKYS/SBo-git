Wise compares a protein sequence to a genomic DNA sequence, allowing for
introns and frameshifting errors.

The Wise package is now a rather stately bioinformatics package that has
been around for a while. Its key programs are genewise, a program for
aligning proteins or protein HMMs to DNA, and dynamite a rather cranky
"macro language" which automates the production of dynamic programming.
