XCircuit is a UNIX/X11 (and Windows, if you have an X-Server running,
or Windows API, if not) program for drawing publishable-quality
electrical circuit schematic diagrams and related figures, and produce
circuit netlists through schematic capture. XCircuit regards circuits
as inherently hierarchical, and writes both hierarchical PostScript
output and hierarchical SPICE netlists. Circuit components are saved
in and retrieved from libraries which are fully editable. XCircuit
does not separate artistic expression from circuit drawing; it
maintains flexiblity in style without compromising the power of
schematic capture.
