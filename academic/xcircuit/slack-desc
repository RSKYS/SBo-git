# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xcircuit: xcircuit (circuit design tool)
xcircuit: XCircuit is a UNIX/X11 (and Windows, if you have an X-Server running,
xcircuit: or Windows API, if not) program for drawing publishable-quality
xcircuit: electrical circuit schematic diagrams and related figures, and
xcircuit: produce circuit netlists through schematic capture. XCircuit regards
xcircuit: circuits as inherently hierarchical, and writes both hierarchical
xcircuit: PostScript output and hierarchical SPICE netlists.
xcircuit: Circuit components are saved in and retrieved from libraries which
xcircuit: are fully editable.
xcircuit: XCircuit was written and is maintained by Tim Edwards, currently
xcircuit: with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
