xiphos (formerly gnomesword. A bible study application)
Xiphos is a bible study program for GNOME. Xiphos is based on the
Sword project by the CrossWire Bible Society.

computer reading of the text using festival has not been tested. if
it works let me know, and i'll remove these two lines from the readme.

xiphos version 4.2.1 requires sword v1.8.1-3 or higher
and biblesync v2.0.1 or higher

xiphos needs a version of cmake 3.11 or higher. A private version is
included in the slackbuild to enable xiphos to be built. If you want to
use a different cmake to that included here, pass CMVERSION with the
version you need (and make sure that the source tar.gz is available)
There are a few new dependencies as the documentation is now created by
the build process rather than shipped preprocessed in the source.
