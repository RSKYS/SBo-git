Z3 is an automated theorem prover and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT) solver. Given a formula in first-order logic, it attempts to
either prove the formula or find a counterexample. Z3 supports
arithmetic, reasoning about arrays, and several other built-in
theories. Input problems are written in SMT-LIB format.

This package includes the z3 program as well as the C++ and
Python APIs. By default the Python 2 version of the API is built;
if you also want the Python 3 version, run the SlackBuild with
PYTHON3=yes, like so:

  PYTHON3=yes ./z3.SlackBuild
