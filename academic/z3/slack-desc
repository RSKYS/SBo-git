# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

z3: z3 (a first-order theorem prover and SMT solver)
z3:
z3: Z3 is an automated theorem prover and satisfiability modulo theories
z3: (SMT) solver. Given a formula in first-order logic, it attempts to
z3: either prove the formula or find a counterexample. Z3 supports
z3: arithmetic, reasoning about arrays, and several other built-in
z3: theories. Input problems are written in SMT-LIB format.
