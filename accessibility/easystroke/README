Easystroke is a gesture-recognition application for X11.  Gestures or
strokes are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen,
finger etc.) while holding down a specific mouse button.  Easystroke
will execute certain actions if it recognizes the stroke; currently
easystroke can emulate key presses, execute shell commands, hold down
modifiers and emulate a scroll wheel.

The program was designed with Tablet PCs in mind and can be used
effectively even without access to a keyboard. Easystroke tries to
provide an intuitive and efficient user interface while at the same
time being highly configurable and offering many advanced features.

If you'd also like the manpage installed, then help2man needs to be
installed and then pass COMPILE_MAN=yes to the slackbuild.
