font-opendyslexic (font designed for readers with dyslexia)

OpenDyslexic is an open sourced font created to increase readability for
readers with dyslexia. It includes regular, bold, italic, bold-italic,
and monospaced styles. It is being updated continually and improved
based on input from dyslexic users.

The fonts are shipped in multiple formats. By default, the package will
include only the OpenType (OTF) fonts. If you need the others, export
the variable FORMATS as a space-separated list of font types. The
choices are: otf ttf eot woff svg. You can also say "all". Example:

# FORMATS="ttf woff" ./font-opendyslexic.SlackBuild

Note that Xorg only knows how to use OpenType and TrueType. The others
will be installed in /usr/share/fonts/<format>, for use with whatever
software you have that supports them.
