svox (small footprint text-to-speech engine)

The SVOX Pico engine is a software speech synthesizer for German,
English (GB and US), Spanish, French and Italian. SVOX produces a clear
and distinct speech output made possible by the use of Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) algorithms.

The package includes the pico2wave utility, and everything else from
the Debian packages libttspico-data, libttspico-dev, libttspico-utils,
and libttspico0.
