# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

unclutter: unclutter (x11 tool for removing mouse clutter from the screen)
unclutter:
unclutter: unclutter is a program which runs permanently in the background of an
unclutter: X11 session.  It checks the X11 pointer (cursor) position every few
unclutter: seconds, and when it has not moved (and no buttons are pressed on the
unclutter: mouse, and the cursor is not in the root window), it creates a small
unclutter: sub-window as a child of the window the cursor is in.  The new window
unclutter: installs a cursor of size 1x1 but a mask of all 0, i.e. an invisible
unclutter: cursor.  This allows you to see all of the text in e.g. an xterm.
