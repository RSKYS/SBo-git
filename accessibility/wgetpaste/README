wgetpaste (command-line interface to various pastebins)

See /etc/wgetpaste.conf.sample for config options.

If you want to use the -x, -X, -C options to wgetpaste, install xclip.

Notes:

- The "codepad" and "gists" services are currently broken. The
  "dpaste" (default) and "bpaste" services work as of 20201024.

- There is a new release of wgetpaste (2.30), but *all* the services
  are broken in 2.30, so it's useless to upgrade.
