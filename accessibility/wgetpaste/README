wgetpaste (command-line interface to various pastebins)

See /etc/wgetpaste.conf.sample for config options.

If you want to use the -x, -X, -C options to wgetpaste, install xclip.
If you want to use the -N option, install ansifilter.

Notes:

- These services worked as of 20240314:
  0x0, dpaste, pgz, bpaste (the default).

- These services are broken (or were, when I tested on 20231220):
  codepad, ix_io.

- The gists (github) and snippets (gitlab) services are untested,
  because they require a user account and authentication tokens in
  wgetpaste.conf. The SlackBuild maintainer doesn't have nor want
  to create accounts on these sites. If you try them, let me know
  if they work, and I'll update this README with the results.
