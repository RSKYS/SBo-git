Collection of DPF-based plugins from DISTRHO.

These come in LADSPA, DSSI, LV2 and VST2 formats, namely
  glBars
  Kars
  Max-Gen examples (MaBitcrush, MaFreeverb, MaGigaverb, MaPitchshift)
  Mini-Series (3BandEQ. 3BandSplitter, PingPongPan)
  ndc-Plugs (Amplitude Imposer, Cycle Shifter, Soul Force)
  MVerb
  Nekobi
  ProM

LV2_ONLY=yes may be set to ommit building ladspa, dssi and vst plugins.

Optional dependencies: jack,dssi,projectM

If compiled against jack, this package uses POSIX filesystem
capabilities to execute with elevated privileges (required for
realtime audio processing). This may be considered a security/stability
risk. Please read http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information.
To disable capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.

This build conflicts with "distrho-mini-series" from SBo, as that build
is a subset of DPF-Plugins.
