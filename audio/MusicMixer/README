MusicIP Mixer is a program by AmpliFIND (formerly MusicIP) that has
features used to analyze music files to generate PUIDs on the MusicDNS
servers, amongst other added value "end user" features (recommending
similar music, building playlists etc)

This is a very CPU-hungry program; you may prefer the cli tool genpuid.
