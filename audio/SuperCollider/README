SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real
time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.  It provides an
interpreted object oriented language which functions as a network
client to a state of the art, realtime sound synthesis server.

To use scvim editor copy the contents of /usr/share/scvim/vim to
~/.vim/

This will perform setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice=ep
to /usr/bin/sclang, /usr/bin/scsynth, /usr/bin/scide and
/usr/bin/scvim. If you don't want this behaviour pass CAPS="no" to the
script.

Pass EMACS=no to the script to disable emacs support. avahi (enabled
with the switch AVAHI=yes), cwiid, and gedit are optional dependencies.

NOTE: yaml-cpp0.3 is a runtime dependency.
