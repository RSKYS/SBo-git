This project aims to ease the usage of legacy, non JACK enabled
applications, in a JACK MIDI enabled system.

Typical usecase is to e.g. connect a software synth like
bristol/azr3 with qtractor/seq24, or even connect midi hardware
with jack applications.

jack already contains parts of the a2jmidid code.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
