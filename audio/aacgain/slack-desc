# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

aacgain: Aacgain enables you to adjust the volume of your files using the
aacgain: replaygain-algorithm. This way only tags are written to your files;
aacgain: they don't get modified themselves.
aacgain: Via these tags, some audio-players are able to change the volume of
aacgain: each song, so that they're all played at the same volume.
