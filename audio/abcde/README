abcde is a frontend command-line utility (actually, a shell script)
that grabs tracks off an audio CD, encodes them to Ogg Vorbis, MP3,
MP2, FLAC, Opus, Speex, WAV, WavPack, Musepack, AIFF, M4A/AAC, MKA,
Monkey's Audio and/or True Audio formats, and tags them all in one go.

There are many additional features that abcde supports by installing one
or more of these dependencies:

* eyeD3           for tagging MP3 files (default)
* id3lib          for tagging MP3 files (with ID3TAGV=id3tag)
* id3v2           for tagging MP3 files (with ID3TAGV=id3v2.3)
* id3             for tagging MP3 files (with ID3TAGV=id3v1)

* twolame         for creating MP2 files
* mutagen         for tagging MP2 and MP3 files (with ID3TAGV=id3v2.3
                  and ID3V2=mid3v2)

* musepack-tools  for creating Musepack files

* fdkaac          for creating M4A/AAC files
* wine            for running qaac and fhgaacenc

* mac             for creating Monkey's Audio files
* apetag          for tagging Monkey's Audio files

* tta             for creating True Audio files (default)

* glyr            for downloading album art
* mkcue           for generating cue sheets for one-album files
* vorbisgain      for adjusting the volume of Ogg Vorbis files

Set CDDBMETHOD to "cddb" if you would like to retrieve music metadata
and album art from freedb instead of MusicBrainz.
