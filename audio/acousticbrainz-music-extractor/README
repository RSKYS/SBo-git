This open source toolkit enables the automatic analysis of music.

Note:
This contains a statically build binary.
From the FAQ:

Besides building your own version being a major pain, it is possible
for different combinations of libraries and compilers (gcc vs clang,
libffmpeg vs libav) to produce slightly different outputs.
We're aiming to reduce the variances of output between the extractors
in an effort to create the most consistent and stable dataset.
(...)
So, for the time being, if it is possible in any way for you to use
one of our static builds, we would greatly appreciate that.
