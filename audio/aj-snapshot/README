Aj-snapshot is a small program that can be used to make snapshots of
the connections made between JACK and/or ALSA clients.

Since JACK provides both audio and MIDI support to programs, aj-snapshot
is able to store both types of connections for JACK.

Run aj-snapshot in daemon mode to have your connections continually
restored.
