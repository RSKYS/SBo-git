alsa-plugin-jack (JACK plugin for ALSA)

This is the JACK audio plugin for ALSA. It allows audio to be routed to
and from ALSA applications that aren't JACK-aware.

For more information, see http://alsa.opensrc.org/Jack_(plugin)

This plugin is included in the alsa-plugins source, but is not included
in Slackware's alsa-plugins package because Slackware doesn't ship
with jack.
