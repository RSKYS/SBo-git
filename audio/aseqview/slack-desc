# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

aseqview: aseqview (ALSA sequencer event viewer)
aseqview:
aseqview: ASeqView is an ALSA sequencer user-client which works as an
aseqview: event viewer. It visualizes received events, e.g. note-on/off,
aseqview: controls, pitch wheels, using bar graphs, as often seen in many
aseqview: sequencer programs. Another feature of ASeqView is redirection
aseqview: of events. ASeqView can output the received events to subscription
aseqview: ports with some modification like channel mute or pitch change. Since
aseqview: this works as a real-time filter client, such modifications can be
aseqview: applied also in real-time without complexity.
