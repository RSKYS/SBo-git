caps (audio plugin suite for LADSPA)

CAPS, the C* Audio Plugin Suite, is a collection of refined LADSPA
audio plugins capable of (and mainly intended for) realtime
operation. The suite includes DSP units emulating instrument
amplifiers, stomp-box classics, versatile 'virtual analogue'
oscillators, fractal oscillation, reverb, equalization and more.

By default, CAPS will use SSE and/or SSE3 optimizations, if they
are supported on the build host. If you're building a package
to be deployed on a different system, you might need to set
FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the script's environment, which will
completely disable SSE/SSE3 (but might cause performance problems, your
mileage may vary).

The CAPS HTML documentation is about 1MB in size, located in
/usr/doc/caps-$VERSION/html/index.html. If you want to leave it out
of the package, set DOCS=no in the script's environment. Note that the
HTML doc is also available online (it's the caps homepage)... but only
the most recent version, which might be newer than this build.

If you're upgrading from an older version of caps, or need to
install an older version of caps for e.g. an old Ardour session, read
UPGRADE.txt.
