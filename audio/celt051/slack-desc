# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

celt051: celt051 (low delay audio codec - version 0.5.1.x)
celt051:
celt051: CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality
celt051: communications. Traditional full-bandwidth codecs such as Vorbis and
celt051: AAC can offer high quality but they require codec delays of hundreds
celt051: of milliseconds, which makes them unsuitable for real-time
celt051: interactive applications like teleconferencing.  Speech targeted
celt051: codecs, such as Speex or G.722, have lower 20-40ms delays but their
celt051: speech focus and limited sampling rates restricts their quality,
celt051: especially for music.
