ChucK is a new (and developing) audio programming language for
real-time synthesis, composition, performance, and now, analysis.

ChucK presents a new time-based, concurrent programming model that's
highly precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), as well
as dynamic control rates, and the ability to add and modify code
on-the-fly. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OSC, HID device, and
multi-channel audio. It's fun and easy to learn, and offers composers,
researchers, and performers a powerful programming tool for building
and experimenting with complex audio synthesis/analysis programs, and
real-time interactive control.

Please e-mail me if it works for 64-bit.

SOUNDENGINE=jack or SOUNDENGINE=oss to enable jack or oss support:
in these cases you will need jack or oss (and the build script will
produce a different binary). SOUNDENGINE=alsa is the default.
