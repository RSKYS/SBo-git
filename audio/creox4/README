creox4 (guitar/etc effects for JACK)

Creox is a real-time sound processor. You can plug your electric
guitar or any other musical instrument directly to the PC's sound card
and start experimenting with various sound effects. Creox has a nice
user-friendly GUI, a preset support, a low-latency DSP engine and each
effect parameter can be altered "on the fly".

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
