dcaenc is a Free Software (LGPL-licensed) encoder for the DTS Coherent
Acoustics audio format.

* It is useful if you want to create a DTS CD or a DTS soundtrack for a
  DVD from a 6-channel PCM wav file using Linux.

* Another use case is related to real-time encoding of multichannel
  PCM audio output from arbitrary linux applications for transmission
  over SPDIF.
