dcd (console CD player)

dcd: a Linux CD player by a slacker, for slackers.

dcd was started because I got tired of having to dedicate a whole 
console to workbone, and the CD players available for X were, at 
the time, universally lacking in features. They're a bit better 
now, though.

dcd plays CDs, lets you set up CD playlists, and does most of what 
a conventional CD player does, in a (hopefully) intuitive manner.
