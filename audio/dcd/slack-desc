# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dcd: dcd (console CD player)
dcd:
dcd: dcd - a Linux CD player by a slacker, for slackers.
dcd:
dcd: dcd was started because I got tired of having to dedicate a whole
dcd: console to workbone, and the CD players available for X were, at
dcd: the time, universally lacking in features. They're a bit better
dcd: now, though.
dcd:
dcd: dcd plays CDs, lets you set up CD playlists, and does most of what
dcd: a conventional CD player does, in a (hopefully) intuitive manner.
