drumkv1 (JACK/LV2 drum machine)

drumkv1 is an old-school all-digital drum-kit sampler synthesizer with
stereo fx. It runs either as a standalone JACK application or an LV2
instrument plugin.

Optional dependencies (autodetected):

lv2 - required to build drumkv1's LV2 instrument plugins.
liblo - required for OSC (Open Sound Control) support.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
