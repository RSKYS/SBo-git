# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ezstream: ezstream (A command line source client for Icecast media streaming)
ezstream:
ezstream: Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming
ezstream: servers. It began as the successor of the old "shout" utility,
ezstream: and has since gained a lot of useful features.  In its basic
ezstream: mode of operation, it streams media files or data from standard
ezstream: input without reencoding and thus requires only very little CPU
ezstream: resources. It can also use various external decoders and encoders
ezstream: to reencode from one format to another, and stream the result to
ezstream: an Icecast server. Additional features include scriptable playlist
ezstream: and metadata handling.
