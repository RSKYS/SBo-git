fIcy (icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite)

fIcy is a small icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite for use under
shell environment. Its goal is to automatically rip a stream into
user customisable files. It will work with ICY compatible streams,
allowing you to either to save the stream to disk or to pipe the output
to a media player, or even both. fIcy, among other uses, is ideal for
batch/unattended recording of radio programs and stream debugging.

The fIcy package includes:

- fIcy itself, a stream separator/multiplexer,
- fResync, a fast MPEG-resyncing utility,
- fPls, a playlist frontend for fIcy.

Note: the name "fIcy" has a capital i in it, not a lowercase L. Hard to
tell in some fonts.
