# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fIcy: fIcy (icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite)
fIcy:
fIcy: fIcy is a small icecast/shoutcast stream grabber suite for use under
fIcy: shell environment. Its goal is to automatically rip a stream into user
fIcy: customisable files. It will work with ICY compatible streams, allowing
fIcy: you to either to save the stream to disk or to pipe the output to
fIcy: a media player, or even both. fIcy, among other uses, is ideal for
fIcy: batch/unattended recording of radio programs and stream debugging.
