flac123 is a command line tool for playing audio files stored in 
the lossless FLAC format. It fills a gap in the existing FLAC tools 
which provide a standalone tool to encode and decode files, a tool 
to manipulate metadata but no command line tool for playback.

Since it uses libao for audio output, it can output to ALSA and Pulse,
despite those not being listed in its --help message.
