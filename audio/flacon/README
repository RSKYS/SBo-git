flacon (Audio File Encoder)

Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing
the entire album of music and saves them as separate audio files.

To do this, it uses information from the appropriate CUE file. Also,
Flacon makes it possible to conveniently revise or specify tags both
for all tracks at once or for each tag separately.

Features:

 * Supported input formats: WAV, FLAC, APE, WavPack, True Audio (TTA).
 * Supported output formats: FLAC, WAV, WavPack, AAC, OGG or MP3.
 * Replay Gain analysis (album-gain and track-gain modes).
 * Multi-threaded conversion process.
 * Automatic character set detection for CUE files.
 * Generation of the per-track CUE file in the output dir.

And the optional dependencies:

 * faac
 * mac
