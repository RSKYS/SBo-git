Fluid General MIDI SoundFont

This is a GM SoundFont, for use with any modern MIDI synthesiser:
hardware (like the emu10k1 sound card) or software (like FluidSynth).

This package includes a shell script wrapper "fluidplay" that runs
fluidsynth with this SoundFont pre-loaded.

This package can also be used with TiMidity++ (have a look at its
/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg).
