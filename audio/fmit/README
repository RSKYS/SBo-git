fmit (Free Music Instrument Tuner) is a piece of software for tuning
musical instruments, using Qt as a GUI library, supporting ALSA, JACK,
OSS, or PortAudio for audio input. Features error and volume history,
tuning scales using Scala (.scl) files, microtonal tuning, harmonic
ratios, wave shapes, and more.

fmit will automatically detect ALSA and if jack, oss or portaudio
support is desired, pass JACK="ON", OSS="ON" or PORTAUDIO="ON" to the
SlackBuild.
