# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

foo-yc20: foo-yc20 (Yamaha YC-20 organ emulator for JACK and LV2)
foo-yc20:
foo-yc20: This is an implementation of a 1969 designed Yamaha combo organ,
foo-yc20: the YC-20.
foo-yc20:
foo-yc20: Original YC-20 organs have a touch vibrato control, which is vibrato
foo-yc20: induced by horizontal movement of the keys. As there very few (almost
foo-yc20: none) midi keyboards which produce such information, this feature has
foo-yc20: been left out of the emulation. Instead of the touch vibrato control,
foo-yc20: the control panel hosts a "realism" switch.
