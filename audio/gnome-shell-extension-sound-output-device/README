A simple selector to enabled selection of sound source and sink based
on Gnome Control Center.
Shows a list of sound output and input devices (similar to gnome sound
settings) in the status menu below the volume slider. Various active 
ports like HDMI , Speakers etc. of the same device are also displayed
for selection. V20+ needs python as dependency. If you want to continue
with the old method without Python, use options to switch off New Port 
identification.
