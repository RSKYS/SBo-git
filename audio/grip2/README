Grip is a gtk-based cd-player and cd-ripper. It has the ripping
capabilities of cdparanoia builtin, but can also use external rippers
(such as cdda2wav).

This is an older version of Grip that does not require GNOME. If you're
looking for a modern version of Grip, see the package "grip".

By default, it is safe to install grip2 and grip at the same time,
although not particularly useful. If you don't plan to install both,
pass SMYLINKS=yes to the build script. This will allow you to run
"grip" and/or "gcd" (instead of having to say "grip2" and "gcd2"). Note
that with SMYLINKS=yes, this package will conflict with the regular
grip package.

Before running grip2 for the first time, you may want to copy the file
"/usr/doc/grip2-2.96/dot.grip.sample" to "$HOME/.grip". This sets the
default encoder to oggenc, and puts the track number at the front of
each output filename.
