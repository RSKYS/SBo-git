gtklick (GUI metronome for JACK)

gtklick is a simple metronome with an easy-to-use GTK interface. As
a frontend to klick, it supports all of klick's features.

klick must be built with OSC (liblo) support to work with gtklick. If
you get 'timeout waiting for klick to start', rebuild your klick package
without LIBLO=no.

You must build this package using "su -" instead of regular "su".
