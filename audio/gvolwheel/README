GVolWheel is a Lightweight application which lets you control 
the audio volume easily through a tray icon you can scroll on. 
Easily integrates with minimal desktops (Openbox, IceWM, XFCE, 
etc).

GVolWheel is not the same as VolWheel. GVolWheel is written in C,
while VolWheel is written in Perl. 

The package is compiled without OSS support by default to avoid
auto-detection of ALSA OSS compatibility libs. 0.7 seemed to have 
problems with this, so it's better to be on the safe side. If you
want to explicitely enable OSS, start the SlackBuild with:

OSS=yes gvolwheel.SlackBuild
