Herrie is a minimalistic music player that uses the command line. It
is written to support a variety of audio subsystems and file formats,
including playlists.

Herrie has a split-screen user interface, with a playlist at the top
of the screen and a file browser at the bottom. Herrie supports XMMS
shortcuts for playback control and can play in XMMS mode or "party"
mode (which acts as a song queue). Herrie also has some more exotic
features, including support for AudioScrobbler and the ability to
chroot() itself into a directory.

The default options for this Slackbuild are set for no scrobbler,
modplugin, wave, or XSPF support. ALSA is the chosen sound output. This
makes it so the program can be built with the least amount of
dependencies (with these options all of them should be included
in Slackware 12.1).  See the README in the herrie source for the
dependencies needed if you enable other options.

This SlackBuild also includes some experimental patches to add
functionality to herrie. These include adding more signals and remote
control, file filtering, and autoquit upon playlist completion.

These patches are not used by default in this slackBuild, so you either
need to set their corresponding option in the build script or run the
script with the respective variable set. For example, this would choose
to use all three patches:

  AUTOQUIT=YES SIGNALS=YES FILTER=YES herrie.SlackBuild

Please see README.SBo for usage and configuration help for this and
other options.
