id3 mass tagger is a tool for listing and manipulating ID3 and
Lyrics3 tags in multiple files. It can generate tag fields from
the filename and other variables, and/or rename files, using an
intuitive syntax.

id3 currently supports the old-style ID3 format with track-number
extension (ID3 v1.1), as well as the more complicated ID3v2 (ID3
v2.2.0, v2.3.0) format. This also means use is pretty much limited
to audio files which use these formats, e.g, MPEG-1 Layer III.
