jaaa (spectrum analyser for JACK)

jaaa (JACK and ALSA Audio Analyser) is an audio signal generator and
spectrum analyser designed to make accurate measurements.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
