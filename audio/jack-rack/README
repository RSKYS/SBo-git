jack-rack (LADSPA effects host)

JACK Rack is an effects "rack" for the JACK low latency audio API. The
rack can be filled with LADSPA effects plugins and can be controlled
using the ALSA sequencer. It's phat; it turns your computer into an
effects box.

Optional build dependency: lash (pass LASH=yes to the script to enable)
Optional runtime dependency: ecasound (for /usr/bin/ecarack script)
