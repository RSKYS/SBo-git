jack1 (realtime low-latency sound server)

JACK is a low-latency audio server written primarily for Linux.  It can
connect a number of different applications to an audio device, as well
as allow them to share audio among themselves.  Its clients can run
in their own processes (ie. as a normal application) or they can run
within a JACK server instance (i.e. as a "plugin").

Optional dependencies are libffado and celt.

This conflicts with jack. Only install one of "jack" or "jack1".

This is the "mature, stable" JACK1 branch. It's not 100% deprecated,
but it no longer receives much attention from the upstream JACK
developers. They recommend not using JACK1 at all, actually.

Note: this build was formerly known as
jack-audio-connection-kit. Before installing this, "removepkg
jack-audio-connection-kit" if you had it installed.

SBo build maintainers, please DO NOT list this as a dependency for
your builds. If the software you're trying to build really does work
with jack1 but not jack, please contact the jack maintainer (currently
B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>. Include the build log and any runtime
error messages in your email, plase.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
