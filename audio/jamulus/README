jamulus (real-time jam session client/server)

The Jamulus software enables musicians to perform real-time jam
sessions over the internet. There is one server running the Jamulus
server software which collects the audio data from each Jamulus client,
mixes the audio data and sends the mix back to each client.

The jamulus binary can be run as a client (default) or a server. See
"jamulus --help" and SERVER.txt for details.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
