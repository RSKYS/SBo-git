jnoise (white and pink noise generator for JACK)

A command line JACK app generating accurate white and pink noise with
Gaussian amplitude distribution.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
