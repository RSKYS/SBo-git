jokosher (a multi-track non-linear audio editor)

Jokosher is a simple and powerful multi-track studio. Jokosher
provides a complete application for recording, editing, mixing and
exporting audio, and has been specifically designed with usability in
mind. The developers behind Jokosher have re-thought audio production
at every level, and created something devilishly simple to use.

Currently, jokosher can't be used with jack. This may change in the
future: what's missing is the jack plugins from gst0-plugins-good.
