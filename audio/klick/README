klick (metronome for jack)

klick is an advanced command-line based metronome for JACK. It allows
you to define complex tempo maps for entire songs or performances.

Optional dependencies:

rubberband - uses the RubberBand library for pitch adjustment, which
results in slightly higher audio quality. Autodetected; disable with
RUBBERBAND=no in the script's environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
