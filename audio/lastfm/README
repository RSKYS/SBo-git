Last.fm is the flagship product from the team that designed the
Audioscrobbler system, a music engine based on a massive collection
of Music Profiles.  Each music profile belongs to one person, and
describes their taste in music.  Last.fm uses these music profiles to
make personalized recommendations, match you up with people who like
similar music, and generate custom radio stations for each person.
