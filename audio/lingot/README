lingot (musical instrument tuner)

Lingot is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and
highly configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars,
its configurability gives it a more general character.

By default, this script builds lingot with JACK support, meaning jack is
required. Most people who connect musical instruments to their Slackware
box will want JACK, since it's required by most serious studio apps
(e.g. ardour).

If you want to build without JACK support, set JACK=no in the script's
environment. The resulting package will only support OSS and ALSA audio.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
