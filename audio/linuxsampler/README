The LinuxSampler project was founded with the goal to produce a
free streaming-capable open source pure software audio sampler with
professional grade features.

Optional dependencies: jack, lv2, dssi, ladspa_sdk

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
