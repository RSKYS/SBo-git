lsmi (map keyboard/mouse/joystick input to ALSA MIDI sequencer events)

These simple user-space drivers support using certain homemade,
repurposed, or commercial devices as MIDI controllers on Linux, even
though the devices themselves are not capable of generating MIDI
messages; this does not include things like MIDI-over-serial or PIC
based projects, which are true MIDI devices.

Reasons for using this software include: achieving MIDI entry on
machines without MIDI ports, reusing old hardware, pure frugality,
and fun.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
