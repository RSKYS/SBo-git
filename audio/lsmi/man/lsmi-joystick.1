.SH NAME

lsmi-joystick \- Linux Pseudo MIDI Input -- Joystick
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsmi-joystick
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

This driver allows any joystick supported by the Linux joydev interface to
be used as a MIDI pitch/modulation controller. Of course, some joysticks are
more suitable than others. I use an old analog flight stick. Holding down
button 1 causes the vertical axis to send pitchbend messages, while button 2
causes the vertical axis to send modulation messages. Holding down both
buttons causes the vertical axis to send pitchbend messages and the
horizontal axis to send modulation messages. 

.SH USAGE

Distribution specific init scripts are not included. The drivers may be
started from init, your .bashrc, by qjackctl, etc. In order to be run by a
non-root user the drivers must have access to the device files in /dev/input.
This may be accomplished by adding a group 'input', adding desired users to
this group, and configuring udev to assign the appropriate ownership to files
in /dev/input. It should be perfectly safe to run the drivers as root,
however.

For realtime scheduling (the \-R option), either use set_rlimits, or set the
appropriate POSIX capabilities on the executable:
.P
/sbin/setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice=ep /usr/bin/lsmi-joystick
.P
The lsmi.SlackBuild script already includes RT scheduling support.
