lv2-mda-metapiano (LV2 port of mdaPiano/mdaEPiano VSTi)

This build includes two LV2-based instruments for use with an LV2 host
that supports MIDI input (e.g. jalv). They are 'mdaPiano' (acoustic
piano simulation) and 'mdaEPiano' (electric piano simulation).

These plugins were ported from the the open source mda VST plugins,
found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mda-vst/.
