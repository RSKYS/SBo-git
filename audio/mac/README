mac (Monkey's Audio Linux port)

mac is a console frontend to Monkey's Audio, able to encode and 
decode APE audio files.

If you're building this for an old x86 CPU that doesn't support MMX,
set ASM=no in the script's environment.

The package is built using upstream's default optimization level,
which is -O3. If you suspect this is causing problems, rebuild with
FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the environment (this will force -O2). If this
actually fixes anything, please email the maintainer with the details.
