# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mda-lv2: mda-lv2 (instrument and effect plugins)
mda-lv2:
mda-lv2: MDA-LV2 is an LV2 port of the MDA plugins by Paul Kellett. It contains
mda-lv2: 36 high-quality plugins for a variety of tasks.
mda-lv2:
mda-lv2: This is a more or less faithful port of both the effects and
mda-lv2: instrument plugins. The only functional difference in code is to
mda-lv2: support LV2-style toggle ports (> 0.0 is on, rather than 0.5). All
mda-lv2: the plugins have been tested, and thanks to several bug fixes this
mda-lv2: collection should be more reliable than the original.
