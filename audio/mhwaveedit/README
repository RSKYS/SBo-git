mhwaveedit (edit, play, and record sound files)

mhWaveEdit is a graphical program for editing, playing, and recording
sound files. It is lightweight, portable, user-friendly, and handles
large files very well.

The program itself has only simple editing features such as cut'n'paste
and volume adjustment, but it can also use Ladspa effect plugins
and the effects provided by the SoX application. It can also support
additional file formats besides wav through libsndfile and mp3/ogg
import and export through lame and oggenc/oggdec.

lame, jack[*], and portaudio are optional dependencies.

[*] If jack support is included, this package uses POSIX filesystem
    capabilities to execute with elevated privileges
    (required for realtime audio processing). This may
    be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
    http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
    capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
