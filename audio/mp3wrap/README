Mp3Wrap is a free independent alternative to AlbumWrap. It's a
command-line utility that wraps quickly two or more mp3 files in one
single large playable mp3, without losing filenames and ID3 informations
(and without need of decoding/encoding). Also with the possibility of
including other non mp3 files, such as PlayLists, info files, cover
images, inside the mp3. This means that you obtain a large mp3 that you
can split in any moment just using mp3splt and in few seconds you have
all original files again! It's useful because files created with Mp3Wrap
are easy to download. Infact who downloads has not to know each single
song name and easy to play and even if you don't have mp3splt to split
file, you can listen to it anyway.  MP3Wrap the Free AlbumWrap.
