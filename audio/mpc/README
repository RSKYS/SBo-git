mpc is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon.
mpc connects to a MPD running on a machine via a network.

For bash tab completion, copy the mpc-completion.bash file in
mpc's documentation directory to ~/.bashrc

You will need to make sure you have set the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT
environment variables.
