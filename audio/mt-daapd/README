mt-daapd is an iTunes server for POSIX systems.  When run, iTunes will
see the music as a shared library to other clients on the LAN, just as
the OS X and Windows clients.

To work properly, the music must be located on the same filesystem
on which the daemon is running.  Also, a template has been placed
in /etc/mt-daapd.conf This file should be edited before the daemon
is run.

An init script has been included for the daemon; to run at boot time,
add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.mt-daapd ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.mt-daapd start
  fi

You might also want to have the daemon shut down gracefully
on system halt or reboot; if so, add the following to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.mt-daapd ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.mt-daapd stop
  fi
