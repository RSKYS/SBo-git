multimidicast sends and receives MIDI from Alsa sequencers over your
network.

It uses UDP multicast datagrams and is thus subscriptionless and
plug'n'play.  This program currently only works on Linux, since the
Alsa API is only available on Linux.

It is designed to interoperate with the windows software ipMIDI or
multimidicast for windows.
