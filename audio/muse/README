MusE is a MIDI/Audio sequencer with recording and editing capabilities
written originally by Werner Schweer now developed and maintained by
the MusE development team. MusE aims to be a complete multitrack
virtual studio for Linux, it is published under the GNU General Public
License.

Optional dependencies are dssi and lash.

To start MusE, the user has to be in the "audio" group.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
