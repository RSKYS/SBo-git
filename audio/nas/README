The Network Audio System is a network transparent, client/server
audio transport system. It can be described as the audio equivalent
of an X server.

Note that some applications will likely need recompiling for nas
support - mplayer for one.

See the /etc/nas/nasd.conf.eg for an example config.

Example server startup command:

nasd :0 -aa -b

Example client command:

AUDIOSERVER=192.168.1.2:0 mplayer -ao nas movie.avi

For full description of options etc. please see nas(1), nasd(1)
and nasd.conf(5).
