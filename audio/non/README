Non is designed to be simple and efficient. Written entirely in C/C++
for high performance. Non is fast enough to run on low-end
processors--while other DAWs require huge investments in hardware. The
NTK toolkit provides lightning fast GUI to all the Non components.

Non is a modular (in the Unix sense) DAW. Other DAWs, even in the
free-software realm, are large, bloated, and, as a rule,
monolithic. This goes against the Unix philosophy and fails to take
full advantage of the power and flexibility of JACK.

MODULES:

The components of Non work together and separately, allowing you
create a studio tailored to your own needs.

If you want to build only one component of Non, you may pass the name
of that component to the SlackBuild script as the variable PROJECT.
For instance:

PROJECT=mixer ./non.SlackBuild

The component names are:
mixer|sequencer|timeline|session-manager

By default, this SlackBuild builds everything, so the result is a
complete, traditional DAW-like suite.
