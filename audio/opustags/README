opustags can read and edit the comment header of an Ogg Opus file.

Tags can be simply viewed, or completely deleted from the Ogg Opus
file as well as being added individually on the same command line.
Tags can also be edited interactively in Vim.

Basic usage can be seen with 'opustags --help' while more detailed
usage can be seen in the man pages.
