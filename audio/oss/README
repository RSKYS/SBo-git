The Open Sound System is a set of sound drivers that serve as an
alternative to the usual ALSA architecture.

Among the benefits are:
* volume levels being settable for each application individually
* better latency than ALSA in most cases

If your WM/DE supports tray icons, you will have one for the OSS
mixer.

See README.SLACKWARE for post-installation instructions and setup
information.
