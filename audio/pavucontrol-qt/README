LXQt's pavucontrol-qt is the Qt port of the volume control pavucontrol
for the sound server PulseAudio. As such it can be used to adjust all
controls provided by PulseAudio and ALSA as well as some additional
settings.

The software belongs to the LXQt project, but its usage isn't limited to
this desktop environment.
