pd is a real-time audio synthesis/processing package.  It is one of
the "MUSIC N" family members, open source (BSD style) successor of the
MAX branch.  This package contains just the core of Pd; more external
objects have been written: many of them are in the CVS at SourceForge.

Optional dependencies are jack and portmidi.
