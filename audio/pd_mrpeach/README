Pure Data externals to work with OSC by mrpeach.

udpsend, udpreceive, tcpsend and tcpreceive are byte-oriented externals
similar to and based on netsend and netreceive.

Start the slackbuild with ALL=YES to build all the objects. In that
case, you have more externals, not specific to Open Sound Control.

After installation go to Pure Data > Media > Preferences > Path > New
and select /usr/lib(64)/pd/extra/mrpeach

Or start Pure Data like this: pd -path /usr/lib(64)/pd/extra/mrpeach
