pianobar is a console client for the personalized web radio pandora
(http://www.pandora.com).

- Play and manage (create, add music, delete, rename, ...) your stations
- Rate played songs and let pandora explain why they have been selected
- Show upcoming songs/song history
- Configure keybindings and text output
- Remote control and eventcmd interface (send tracks to last.fm, e.g.)
- Proxy support for listeners outside the USA

Included with this SlackBuild is a helper script called pianobarctl that
allows the user to remotely control some pianobar functions.  To use
this a FIFO must first be created by the user:

  mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

Please see man pianobar and pianobarctl --help for more information.
The documentation also includes a few example scripts you can use with
pianobar.

NOTE:
If you are getting an error stating your TLS fingerprint is incorrect,
you need to configure pianobar so that it has the correct one.

You can execute the following script to get a new TLS fingerprint:

  sh /usr/doc/pianobar-$VERSION/example-scripts/tls_fingerprint.sh

Then open your pianobar configuration in your user's home directory
(~/.config/pianobar/config) and add the following line:

  tls_fingerprint = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

If for some reason you receive an error about the TLS fingerprint
again, just execute tls_fingerprint.sh again and ammend your user's
configuration file.
