Take over audio/media system totally by Pipewire this time!

Important Notes:
Blacklist following packages to prevent any reinstall for this package:

daemon
pulseaudio

Or, just don't accept any .NEW configs from pulse while you upgrade by
slackpkg.

In case you want to switch back to pulseaudio, install
"pulseaudio-pipe", it will automatically remove this package if it's
installed; So you can recognize what mode you're on.

You need to reboot or atleast re-login, so changes appear.
