Python Audio Tools are a collection of audio handling programs which
work from the command line.  These include programs for CD extraction,
track conversion from one audio format to another, track renaming and
retagging, track identification, CD burning from tracks, and more.
It supports internationalized track filenames and metadata using
Unicode.  It works with high-definition, multi-channel audio as well
as CD-quality.  Track conversion uses multiple CPUs or CPU cores if
available to greatly speed the transcoding process.  Track metadata can
be retrieved from FreeDB or FreeDB-compatible servers.

Supported audio formats are WAV, AIFF, Sun AU, FLAC, WavPack, MP3, MP2,
Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Speex, Ogg FLAC, and M4A.
