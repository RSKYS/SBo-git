qjackctl (Qt application to control the JACK sound server)

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon
parameters, which are properly saved between sessions, and a way
control of the status of the audio server daemon. With time, this
primordial interface has become richer by including a enhanced
patchbay and connection control features.

qjackctl supports either qt5 or qt6. If qt6 is found at build time,
it will be used; otherwise, qt5 will be used. This isn't a problem,
just something to be aware of.

Note: This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.

Optional dependency: portaudio
