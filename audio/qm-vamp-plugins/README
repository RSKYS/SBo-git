qm-vamp-plugins (audio feature extraction plugins)

Audio feature extraction plugins from Queen Mary, University of London

A set of plugins for feature extraction from audio data, using the Vamp
plugin format suitable for use in programs such as Sonic Visualiser and
Sonic Annotator.

This build supports SSE and SSE2 CPU optimizations. By default, the
script examines your system and enables SSE and/or SSE2 if they're
supported. If you're building a package for a different system, you
can override this behaviour via environment variables, like so:

SSE=no           # Force disable SSE and SSE2 (variable SSE2 ignored)
SSE=yes SSE2=yes # Force enable both SSE and SSE2
SSE=yes SSE2=no  # Force enable SSE, force disable SSE2

Leaving SSE blank or setting it to anything else means to autodetect.
