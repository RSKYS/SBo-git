QmidiNet is a MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives
MIDI data(ALSA Sequencer) over the network, using UDP/IP multicast.

Inspired by multimidicast (http://llg.cubic.org/tools) and designed to
be compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (http://nerds.de).

jack is an optional dependency.
