This is the qt5 version. For the qt4 version, see the qmmp SlackBuild.

Qmmp is an audio-player, written with help of Qt library.
The user interface is similar to winamp or xmms.

Qmmp can optionally use the following applications:
libmms, libmpcdec, soxr + jack, libmodplug, faad2,
libbs2b, libprojectM, and libenca.

You need soxr and jack to enable JACK support.
