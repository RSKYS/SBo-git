# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

qsynth: into a softsynth management application allowing the user to control
qsynth: and manage a variety of command line softsynths, but for the moment,
qsynth: it wraps the excellent FluidSynth <http://www.fluidsynth.org>
