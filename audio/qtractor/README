Qtractor is an Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer application written in
C++ with the Qt5 framework. Target platform is Linux, where the Jack
Audio Connection Kit (JACK) for audio, and the Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA) for MIDI, are the main infrastructures to evolve
as a fairly-featured Linux desktop audio workstation GUI, specially
dedicated to the personal home-studio.

Optional dependencies include libvorbis, libmad libsamplerate, liblo,
librubberband, dssi, VST SDK, lv2, nsm and suil (recommended).
