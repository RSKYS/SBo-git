rakarrack (realtime audio effects processor for JACK)

Rakarrack is a virtual digital effects rack, including such effects as
distortion, echo, reverb, phaser, flanger, chorus, compressor, etc.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
