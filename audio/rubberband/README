rubberband (audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting)

Rubber Band is a library and utility program that permits you to change 
the tempo and pitch of an audio recording independently of one another.

Starting with version 1.8.2, rubberband can be built with optional Java
JNI support. To do this, install jdk or openjdk, make sure its profile
script has been sourced (normally by logging out & back in), and build
rubberband with JAVA=yes set in the environment.
