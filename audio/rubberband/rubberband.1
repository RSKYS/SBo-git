.SH NAME
rubberband \- an audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting utility program
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrubberband\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fIinput file\fB\fR ] [ \fB\fIoutput file\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the
\fBrubberband\fR command.
.PP
Rubber Band is a program that permits you to change the
tempo and pitch of an audio recording independently of one
another.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax,
with long options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of
options is included below.
.PP
You must specify at least one of the following time and
pitch ratio options.
.TP
\fB-t, --time \fIX\fB\fR
Stretch to \fIX\fR times original
duration, or
.TP
\fB-T, --tempo \fIX\fB\fR
Change tempo by multiple \fIX\fR (equivalent to --time 1/X)
.TP
\fB-p, --pitch \fIX\fB\fR
Raise pitch by \fIX\fR semitones, or
.TP
\fB-f, --frequency \fIX\fB\fR
Change frequency by multiple \fIX\fR
.PP
The following option provides a simple way to adjust the
sound.  See below for more details.
.TP
\fB-n, --crisp \fIN\fB\fR
Crispness (N = 0,1,2,3,4,5); default 4 (see below)
.PP
The remaining options fine-tune the processing mode and
stretch algorithm.  These are mostly included for test purposes;
the default settings and standard crispness parameter are
intended to provide the best sounding set of options for most
situations.
.TP
\fB-P, --precise\fR
Aim for minimal time distortion (implied by -R)
.TP
\fB-R, --realtime\fR
Select realtime mode (implies -P --no-threads)
.TP
\fB--no-threads\fR
No extra threads regardless of CPU and channel count
.TP
\fB--threads\fR
Assume multi-CPU even if only one CPU is identified
.TP
\fB--no-transients\fR
Disable phase resynchronisation at transients
.TP
\fB--bl-transients\fR
Band-limit phase resync to extreme frequencies
.TP
\fB--no-peaklock\fR
Disable phase locking to peak frequencies
.TP
\fB--no-softening\fR
Disable large-ratio softening of phase locking
.TP
\fB--window-long\fR
Use longer processing window (actual size may vary)
.TP
\fB--window-short\fR
Use shorter processing window
.TP
\fB--thresh \fIN\fB \fIF\fB\fR
Set internal freq threshold \fIN\fR (N = 0,1,2) to \fIF\fR Hz
.TP
\fB-d, --debug \fIN\fB\fR
Select debug level (N = 0,1,2,3); default 0, full 3
(N.B. debug level 3 includes audible ticks in output)
.TP
\fB-q, --quiet\fR
Suppress progress output
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Show a list of available options
.PP
Crispness levels:
.TP
\fB0\fR
equivalent to --no-transients --no-peaklock --window-long
.TP
\fB1\fR
equivalent to --no-transients --no-peaklock
.TP
\fB2\fR
equivalent to --no-transients
.TP
\fB3\fR
equivalent to --bl-transients
.TP
\fB4\fR
default processing options
.TP
\fB5\fR
equivalent to --no-peaklock --window-short (may be suitable for drums)
