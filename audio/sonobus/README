SonoBus is an easy to use application for streaming high-quality,
low-latency peer-to-peer audio between devices over the internet
or a local network. 
Simply choose a unique group name (with optional password), and
instantly connect multiple people together to make music, remote
sessions, podcasts, etc. Easily record the audio from everyone,
as well as playback any audio content to the whole group. 

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
