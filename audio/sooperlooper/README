sooperlooper (live audio looping sampler)

SooperLooper is a live looping sampler capable of immediate loop
recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more.  It allows 
for multiple simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your 
computer's available memory.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
