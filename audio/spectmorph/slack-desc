# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

spectmorph: spectmorph (Analyze samples and combine them)
spectmorph: SpectMorph is a free software project which allows to analyze
spectmorph: samples of musical instruments, and to combine them (morphing).
spectmorph: It can be used to construct hybrid sounds, for instance a sound
spectmorph: between a trumpet and a flute; or smooth transitions, for
spectmorph: instance a sound that starts as a trumpet and then gradually
spectmorph: changes to a flute. In its current version, SpectMorph ships
spectmorph: with many ready-to-use instruments which can be combined
spectmorph: using morphing.
