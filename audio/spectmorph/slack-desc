# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

spectmorph: spectmorph (analyze audio samples and combine them)
spectmorph:
spectmorph: SpectMorph is a free software project which allows to analyze samples
spectmorph: of musical instruments, and to combine them (morphing). It can be used
spectmorph: to construct hybrid sounds, for instance a sound between a trumpet
spectmorph: and a flute; or smooth transitions, for instance a sound that starts
spectmorph: as a trumpet and then gradually changes to a flute. In its current
spectmorph: version, SpectMorph ships with many ready-to-use instruments which can
spectmorph: be combined using morphing.
