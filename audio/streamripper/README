Streamripper records SHOUTcast and Icecast compatible streams. It uses
meta data within a SHOUTcast stream to determine the beginning and end
of each song, and stores the songs on your hard disk as individual mp3
files. In addition, Streamripper includes a relay server for listening
to the station while you are recording.
