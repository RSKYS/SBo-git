Audio Tag Tool is a program to manage the information fields in MP3
and Ogg Vorbis files, commonly called tags. It is available under the
GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

Tag Tool can be used to edit tags one by one, but the most useful
features are the ability to easily tag or rename hundreds of files at
once, in any desired format.
