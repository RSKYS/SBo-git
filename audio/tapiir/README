tapiir (software multitap delay with realtime audio I/O)

tapiir's internal processing modules consist of six delay-lines, each
with a mixer at it's input and a gain control at it's output, and a
stereo output mixer. Stereo input from an external source, typically a
musical instrument, is routed to all input mixers. In addition to this,
the output of each delay line is also routed to the input mixers of all
delay lines, including itself.

If you're running an OSSv4-only system with JACK, try passing ALSA=no
to this script to omit ALSA support. Untested by script author; if it
works for you, please let me know.

The example presets can be found /usr/doc/tapiir-0.7.3/examples/; most
of these sound pretty good.
