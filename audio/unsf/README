unsf (converts SoundFont .sf2 files into GUS-type instrument patches)

UnSF is a tool to convert SoundFont (sf2) files into GUS
patches. libunsf is a library that is used by UnSF.

Some reasons you might want to do such a thing are:

    - Your MIDI player can use GUS patches but doesn't know how to read
      soundfonts.

    - You want a convenient way of substituting patches or reassigning
      banks of instruments by editing GUS config files.

    - You need to modify patches by changing amplitude, stripping
      envelopes, or make other changes that can easily be done by
      attaching options in config files.

Note: the set of patches created by unsf will be quite a bit larger
that the original .sf2 file. As an example, FluidR3_GM.sf2 (from
fluid-soundfont) is a 142MB file, and it converts to almost 2GB of
patches (size increased by a factor of 13.5).
