vocoder-ladspa (LADSPA vocoder plugin)

A vocoder is a sound effect that can make a human voice sound
synthetic. It is often used to speak like a robot, with a metallic and
monotonous voice.

This build is intended for use with LADSPA-aware applications such as
ardour or jack-rack. For a standalone version of this effect, see the
vocoder build.
