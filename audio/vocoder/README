vocoder (standalone JACK vocoder effect)

A vocoder is a sound effect that can make a human voice sound
synthetic. It is often used to speak like a robot, with a metallic and
monotonous voice.

This is a standalone JACK application. For a LADSPA version of the same
effect, see vocoder-ladspa.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
