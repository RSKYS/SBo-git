Volume.app -- a simple windowmaker volume control dockapp
========================================================================

This is a simple volume control for the AfterStep / BlackBox /
Window Maker dock. Volume.app is intended to be an extremely simple,
efficient, and attractive interface to a system's sound mixer.

Currently, only OSS mixer interface is supported. ALSA mixer can be used
through ALSA's OSS emulation.

========================================================================

NOTE:  The hacks/mods are for "ALSA's OSS emulation" in ALSA systems.

NOTE2: There are two 'mod' files: "config.h.in.mod" and
       "volume.app.c.mod".
       If you want to use them, simply rename them to each "original
       filename" (remove ".mod" on filename).

       "volume.app.c.mod" is a hack to fix the mute/unmute problem
       for ALSA systems. (It uses "amixer" command as background).

       "config.h.in.mod" is just a covenience to set some parameters.
       eg: If you notice that the app is not running on the right mixer
          (more than 1 soundcard), you may try to set the default mixer
          before creating the package!

          'cat /proc/asound/oss/sndstat' and search the "Mixers"
          section.  Locate the desired 'mixer number' and then modify
          file "config.h.in.mod" at "DEFAULT_MIXER_DEVICE" parameter.

          Eg2: if desired mixer is "2", modify "config.h.in.mod"
          as below:

          DEFAULT_MIXER_DEVICE "/dev/mixer"
          ( to )
          DEFAULT_MIXER_DEVICE "/dev/mixer2"

        Again, do not forget to rename the file "config.h.in.mod" to
        "config.h.in" before creating the package.
