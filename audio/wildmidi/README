WildMIDI is a simple software midi player which has a core softsynth
library that can be used in other applications.

The WildMIDI library uses Gravis Ultrasound patch files to convert
MIDI files into audio which is then passed back to the calling
application. The library API is designed so that it is easy to include
WildMIDI into applications that wish to include MIDI file playback.
