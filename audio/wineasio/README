WineASIO provides an ASIO to JACK driver for WINE. ASIO is the most
common Windows low-latency driver, so is commonly used in audio
workstation programs.

To build the package, you will need the file "asio.h" from the
Steinberg ASIO SDK, version 2.1 or greater. This file must be
downloaded from http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html and
copied to the directory containing the SlackBuild.

After installing the package, each user who will use wineasio must run
the command "regsvr32 wineasio.dll". This must be done as the user(s),
not as root. This only needs to be done once per user.

This can't be built on a stock Slackware64 system, since it requires
32-bit Wine. It may (or may not) be possible to build on a 64-bit
multilib system; let me know how it goes.
