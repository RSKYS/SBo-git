wmusic-xmms (xmms remote control dockapp)

- VCR style controls including fast rewind and fast forward
- Time and Playlist position display
- Super stylee rotating arrow
- Hiding of the xmms windows (on startup and through middle-click)

This is actually wmusic version 1.5.0. It works only with xmms 1.x,
which is the xmms that ships with Slackware. If you want to control
xmms2, or other audio players such as audacious, amarok, vlc, etc,
install wmusic instead.
