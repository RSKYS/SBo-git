wmusic (audio player remote control dockapp)

wmusic is a dockapp that remote-controls music players. Here is a list
of the features:

- VCR style controls including fast rewind and fast forward
- Time and Playlist position display
- Super stylee rotating arrow
- Hiding of the player window (on startup and through middle-click)

Note: this version of wmusic can only control players that implement
the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification. Examples: audacious, amarok,
spotify, blc, bmp, xmms... but NOT xmms 1 (the xmms that ships with
Slackware). Use wmusic-xmms instead, to control xmms 1.
