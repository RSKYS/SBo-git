xmms-ladspa (LADSPA plugin support for XMMS)

XMMS LADSPA is an Effect for XMMS that provides (some of) the power of
the Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API to your everyday MP3 and
all-around media player. It's Free Software of course, under the GNU
General Public License.

Note: the LADSPA plugins from guitarix are incompatible with
xmms-ladspa.  They won't appear in the list of effects, when
configuring the plugin from within xmms.

If xmms segfaults when you try to configure the LADSPA plugin, please
contact the maintainer of this build.
