xwax is an open-source Digital Vinyl System (DVS) for Linux.
It allows DJs and turntablists to playback digital audio
files (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC and more), controlled using a
normal pair of turntables via timecoded vinyls.

It's designed for both beat mixing and scratch mixing. Needle drops,
pitch changes, scratching, spinbacks and rewinds are all supported,
and feel just like the audio is pressed onto the vinyl itself.

The focus is on an accurate vinyl feel which is efficient, stable
and fast.

Optionally install `faad' (AAC) and/or `ffmpeg' in advance for various
additional audio formats. With stock Slackware packages, it already
supports MP3, OGG, FLAC, WAV, AIFC & PCM.
`xwax-import` needs `ffmpeg' for other media than MP3 or CDAUDIO.

Note:
xwax does not work without realtime priorities and so uses POSIX
filesystem capabilities to execute with elevated privileges
(required for realtime audio processing). This may be considered
a security/stability risk.
