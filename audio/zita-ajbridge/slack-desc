# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zita-ajbridge: zita-ajbridge (ALSA <=> JACK bridge)
zita-ajbridge:
zita-ajbridge: zita-ajbridge provides two applications, zita-a2j and zita-j2a.
zita-ajbridge: They allow using an ALSA device as a Jack client, to provide
zita-ajbridge: additional capture (a2j) or playback (j2a) channels. Functionally
zita-ajbridge: these are equivalent to the alsa_in and alsa_out clients that come
zita-ajbridge: with JACK, but they provide much better audio quality.
