zita-dpl1 (limiter for JACK)

Zita-dpl1 is a look-ahead digital peak level limiter using some special
algorithms to allow fast response without excessive LF distortion.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
