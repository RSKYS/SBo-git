Beancount is a double-entry accounting system that uses a simple text
file format as input.  A few Python scripts are used to parse the
contents of the file, for example, to serve the contents as a locally
running web server.  Scripts are provided to convert from OFX files into
Ledger input format, and other formats (easily extensible).

Beancount provides a simple web front to view the contents of the
database, so you don't have to parse the entire file everytime you want
to view a different account (this helps mitigate the fact that parsing
is comparatively slow).
