Stansoft is Linux financial accounting software for business. It uses a
PostgreSQL database, which is included. You can optionally use an IBM
Informix Innovator-C database, which can be downloaded free of charge
from IBM. There is no limit on the number of users per installation,
which allows for scalability from small to large companies. The user
interface is ncurses / terminal based to optimize data entry efficiency.
It can be run locally or deployed remotely on a virtual cloud server.

You must have a stansoft user and group to run this script:
# groupadd -g 325 stansoft
# useradd -u 325 -g 325 -c \"Stansoft user\" -s /bin/bash stansoft

If you wish to use IBM Informix, please add informix user and group as
well
# groupadd -g 326 informix
# useradd -u 326 -g 326 -c \"Informix user\" -s /bin/bash informix

NOTES:
1) After installing the Slackbuild you must run the Stansoft
   installation script /opt/stansoft/install

2) Installation and setup help can be found in /opt/stansoft/README and
   the manual is located at /opt/stansoft/doc/ssmanual.pdf

3) stansoft and informix are the database administrator account, so
   please set a strong password for it.
