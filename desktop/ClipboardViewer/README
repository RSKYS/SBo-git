ClipboardViewer is a qui app to display the current gnome clipboard
either as text or a picture ( a la OSX ) in a small window.  You can
also use it from the command line ( or script ) to print the text
on the clipboard to stdout or create a png image file in the current
directory.

A nautilus script to convert the clipboard contents
into either a text or a picture clipping is installed in
/usr/share/ClipboardViewer/scripts/ - you may want to create a symlink
from this script to your own nautilus scripts directory (usually
~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/)
