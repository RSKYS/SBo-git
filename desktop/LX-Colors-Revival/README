LX-Colors-Revival (GTK2/GTK3/Openbox themes)

This is an attempt to keep the legendary GNOME-Colors icon theme and the
Shiki-Colors theme series alive, in four variations, such as Light,
Mixed (light, but with dark menus), NeoShiki (the LXDE/Openbox successor
to Shiki-Colors), and Pitchdark (all-dark variations).

New features in this edition includes:

* Two new color schemes: Carbonite (dark gray) and Tribute (light gray,
  kinda gold-ish)
* An update to the GNOME-Colors icon theme series that now includes the
  new aforementioned colors, created by Kylie McClain of Somasis.com.
  Please give her some love and thank her for her hard work.

NOTE!
From the GTK3 themes, only Pitchdark seems to work fine with modern
versions of the toolkit, hence the others are not included in the
package.
