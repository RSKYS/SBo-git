AfterStep is a window manager for the Unix X Window System.  Originally
based on the look and feel of the NeXTStep interface, it provides
end users with a consistent, clean, and elegant desktop. The goal
of AfterStep development is to provide for flexibility of desktop
configuration, improving aestetics, and efficient use of system
resources.  Some of the distinguishing features of AfterStep compared
to other window managers are its low usage of resources, stability,
and configurability.
