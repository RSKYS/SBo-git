AllTray is an application which docks other application software
into the system tray ("notification area") of a desktop environment
such as GNOME, KDE, or XFCE. It aims to be independent of both
desktop environment and window manager.

Example for `jack-rack`: alltray -H -p `ps -C jack-rack -o pid=`
