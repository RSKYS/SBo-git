autorandr is a Python program that provides command-line utilities
to manage display configuration. In addition, it has built in udev
configuration files to detect monitor changes, bash-completion, xdg
autostart scripts and pm-utils helpers.

You can optionally specify a TARGETS option to select which
components to build and install. The manpage is always necessary.

For example:

TARGETS="manpage autorandr launcher udev pmutils"

The available options are manpage, autorandr, launcher, udev,
pmutils, autostart_config, bash_completion.
