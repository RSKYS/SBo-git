AWeather is a free/open source application which has been designed 
to integrate and visualize high-quality meteorological data using an 
interactive Virtual Globe interface suitable for a wide range of 
users including weather enthusiasts, academics, and professionals. 
It is designed to provide more information than is typically 
available from weather widgets and simple desktop applications. At 
the same time, it strives to be simpler and easier to use than 
existing meteorological software packages such as GEMPAK and IDV. 
Currently AWeather only displays data provided by the United States 
National Weather Service.
