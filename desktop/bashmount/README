bashmount (manage removeable media)

bashmount is a menu-driven bash script that can use different
backends to easily mount, unmount or eject removable devices without
dependencies on any GUI. An extensive configuration file allows many
aspects of the script to be modified and custom commands to be run
on devices.

bashmount can also be used alongside any automounting solutions, such
as graphical file managers, udev rules, or Udiskie.

An example configuration file is located at "/etc/bashmount.conf",
with all options commented out. You can modify this, or copy it to
"~/.config/bashmount/config" and modify it as desired, on a per-user
basis.
