Bashrun provides a powerful application launcher by running a
specialized bash session in a small terminal window, conveniently
providing bash features like tab-completion and history.  Additional
features include user configurable rules for automatically launching
certain commands in a new terminal window, looking up manual and
info pages, performing dict and google queries, defining bookmarks
for webpages or piping command output to the clipboard.

This can use xdotool, zenity, or kdialog if installed.
