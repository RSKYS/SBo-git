bashrun2 adds application launching capabilities to interactive bash
sessions, suitable for use in a graphical user environment.  In its
default setup, bashrun2 provides an application launcher in the
fashion of a simple run dialog by starting an interactive bash
session in a small xterm(1) terminal window (the builtin run-dialog
mode).
