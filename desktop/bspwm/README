bspwm (Binary space partitioning window manager)

bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the
leaves of a full binary tree. It only responds to X events, and
the messages it receives on a dedicated socket.

bspwm doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs: a third
party program (e.g. sxhkd) is needed in order to translate
keyboard and pointer events to bspc invocations.
