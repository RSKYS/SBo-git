# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bspwm: bspwm (Binary space partitioning window manager)
bspwm:
bspwm: bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the
bspwm: leaves of a full binary tree. It only responds to X events,
bspwm: and the messages it receives on a dedicated socket.
bspwm: bspwm doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs: a third party
bspwm: program (e.g. sxhkd) is needed in order to translate keyboard and
bspwm: and pointer events to bspc invocations.
