clipmenu (clipboard management using dmenu)

clipmenu is a simple clipboard manager using dmenu (or rofi with
CM_LAUNCHER=rofi) and xsel.

This build includes clipnotify, since it's used only by clipmenu.

After installing the package, start clipmenud from your ~/.xinitrc,
before the line that executes your window manager:

  clipmenud &>/dev/null &

While clipmenud is running, the clipmenu command will bring up a
dmenu where you can select previously-copied text. If you want to
bind this command to a keystroke, xbindkeys is highly recommended. In
~/.xbindkeysrc, use something like:

"clipmenu &"
  Control+Alt + C
