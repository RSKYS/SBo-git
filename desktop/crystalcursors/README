Crystal xcursors by Marco Martin 2003-2004

Four different mouse cursor icon sets in the KDE CrystalSVG style. 
In white, gray, blue and green versions. They can be selected from 
the KDE Control Center under Peripherals,Mouse.

Source borrowed from the Ubuntu repository as the original site 
does not appear to be hosting these and more.  If anyone knows of
a more "correct" source location, please advise.

We've modified the upstream-intended result just a bit - it installs 
a /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme file which can/will potentially 
modify the system-wide default cursor theme simply by installing the 
resulting package.  This is (in our opinion) not acceptable; therefore, 
we move that index.theme file to the documentation directory as: 
  index.theme.default
If you want to use it as the default, then you can manually create the 
/usr/share/icons/default directory and restore the file to its original 
name in that directory.  Alternatively, you could set the cursor theme 
with your window manager (which is probably the best option if your
window manager supports it).
