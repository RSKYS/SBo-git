Dash to Panel is an icon taskbar for Gnome Shell. This extension moves 
the dash into the gnome main panel so that the application launchers
and system tray are combined into a single panel, similar
to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+. A separate dock is no 
longer needed for easy access to running and favorited applications.
