Devil's Pie 2 - A window-matching utility

Devilspie2 is a window-matching utility, allowing the user to perform 
scripted actions on windows as they are created. For example, you can
script a terminal program to always be positioned at a specific screen
position, or position a window on a specific workspace.

Devilspie2 is based on the program Devilspie by Ross Burton. The
difference is that Devilspie2 has replaced the symbolic expressions of
the original with a Lua interpreter, making it much easier to maintain
and extend.

Please note that the rules of Devilspie2 are not compatible with the
symbolic expressions of the original Devilspie.

Please see the README for more information and examples of use.

This script will build the package with support for GTK 3 and Lua 5.1,
but if you prefer building it with other versions,
i.e GTK 2 and Lua 5.4, use

  GTK2=on LUA=5.4 devilspie2.SlackBuild

Also the compiler can be set optionally, i.e CC=clang.
