dwl is a compact, hackable compositor for Wayland based on wlroots.
It is intended to fill the same space in the Wayland world that dwm
does in X11, primarily in terms of philosophy, and secondarily in terms
of functionality. Like dwm, dwl is:

•Easy to understand, hack on, and extend with patches
•One C source file (or a very small number) configurable via config.h
•Limited to 2000 SLOC to promote hackability
•Tied to as few external dependencies as possible

dwl is not meant to provide every feature under the sun.
Instead, like dwm, it sticks to features which are
necessary, simple, and straightforward to implement given the base on
which it is built. Implemented default features are:

•Any features provided by dwm/Xlib: simple window borders, tags,
keybindings, client rules, mouse move/resize. Providing a
built-in status bar is an exception to this goal, to avoid
dependencies on font rendering and/or drawing libraries when an
external bar could work well.
•Configurable multi-monitor layout support, including position and
rotation
•Configurable HiDPI/multi-DPI support
•Idle-inhibit protocol which lets applications such as mpv disable
idle monitoring
•Provide information to external status bars via stdout/stdin
•Urgency hints via xdg-activate protocol
•Support screen lockers via input-inhibitor protocol
•Various Wayland protocols
•XWayland support as provided by wlroots (can be enabled in config.mk)
•Zero flickering - Wayland users naturally expect that
"every frame is perfect"
•Layer shell popups (used by Waybar)
•Damage tracking provided by scenegraph API

NOTE: the autostart patch is enabled by default, if you need a
wallpaper modify the autostart patch file at line 23 and change
"swaybg --image /xap/local/background", NULL, to
"swaybg -i (your wallpaper path)", NULL,

If you want to start dwl without a login manager just type dwl
If you want to start dwl with somebar launch with: dwl -s somebar
You can disable the autostart patch and use azote to have a wallpaper
like this dwl -s ~/.azotebg

Suggested programs:
swaybg for background/wallpaper
bemenu wayland menu
fuzzel wayland menu
rofi-lbonn-wayland
alacritty terminal emulator
foot terminal emulator
