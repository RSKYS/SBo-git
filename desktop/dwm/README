dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in
tiled and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied
dynamically, optimizing the environment for the application
in use and the task performed. It is the little brother of
wmii.

As of 6.1, `st` is the default terminal. This does not
require installing `st`, only symlinking your favorite
terminal to:

  /usr/local/bin/st

If a config.h is found in the SlackBuild directory it will
be copied to the source directory and used in the build,
allowing easy customisation.

See README.CONFIG for more information.


OPTIONS

Use the full xinitrc with ConsoleKit and dbus support:

  CK=yes sh dwm.SlackBuild

Use the system tray patch:

  SYSTRAY=yes sh dwm.SlackBuild

Use Mod4 (Windows key) instead of Mod1 (alt):

  MOD4=yes sh dwm.SlackBuild

Use rofi instead of dmenu:

  ROFI=yes sh dwm.SlackBuild

Enable keypad for tags as well as top row digits:

  KEYPAD=yes sh dwm.SlackBuild

The ROFI option also installs dwm.rasi rofi theme to
/usr/share/rofi/themes.  This is set to use the same
font as dwm, so if you have patched the dwm font then you
may also want to adjust it to match.


OPTIIONAL

st

A good minimal terminal with fontconfig support.  Think
"urxvt", but without perl support or the need to specify
fallback fonts manually.

rofi

A good replacement for dmenu, which caches commands hit rate
so that the most used ones are listed first and saves a lot
of extra typing.  Cache can be cleared by deleting
~/.cache/rofi-*.runcache


NOTE

Some java applications seem to have problems displaying in
dwm.  If you find any problems try:

export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1

in your shell before starting the application.  This is
known to fix pycharm.
