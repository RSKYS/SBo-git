dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled and
floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing
the environment for the application in use and the task performed. It is
the little brother of wmii.

As of 6.1, `st' is the default terminal. This does not require
installing `st', only symlinking your favourite terminal to:

  /usr/local/bin/st

If a config.h is found in the SlackBuild directory it will be copied to
the source directory and used in the build, allowing easy customisation.

See README.CONFIG for more information.

OPTIONS

The following options all default to `no', but can be enabled by E.G.:

  CK=yes ./dwm.SlackBuild

An xinitrc with ConsoleKit and dbus support:         CK=yes
A system tray patch:                                 SYSTRAY=yes
Use Mod4 (Windows key) instead of Mod1 (alt):        MOD4=yes
Use rofi instead of dmenu:                           ROFI=yes
Enable keypad for tags as well as top row digits:    KEYPAD=yes
Enable extra patches (in patches directory):         PATCHES=yes
Change default bar font size:                        FONTSIZE=N

Multiple options can be used together.

The ROFI option also installs dwm.rasi rofi theme to
/usr/share/rofi/themes.  This uses the same font as dwm, so if you have
patched the dwm font then you may also want to adjust it to match.

OPTIIONAL

st: A very minimal terminal with fontconfig support.  Think `urxvt', but
with automatic font fallback.

rofi: A replacement for dmenu with more features, themes etc.

NOTE

The following may fix problems displaying java applications:

export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1

This should be run in the shell before starting the application.  This
is known to fix pycharm.
