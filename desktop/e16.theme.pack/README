Theme Pack for e16, Eterm, audacious, and gkrellm2. If you have any one
of these applications installed, this will install themes for the ones
you have installed.

They go along with your e16 current theme for those applications as
well.  Not all e16 themes, but most of them.

audacious and gkrellm2 you have to change manually to match e16.

For gkrellm2, the plugins on my slack. They are installed in
/usr/lib64/gkrellm2, but themes do not work in that directory.  So, if
you have that installed in /usr/lib64/ then it will put the themes in
/usr/share/gkrellm2/themes, or not at all.

If these applicaions are not installed at the time you run this, they
will not be installed, if you install the applications later, then
you'll have to run this slackbuild again to get them installed.

The applications, at least one of them have to be installed in order
for this to install anything.
