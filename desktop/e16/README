The Enlightenment DR16 Window Manager is a robust, flexible, highly
configurable, graphically rich, yet unobtrusive desktop environment for
the X11 windowing system. It is fully themable and easily configured.
There are a wide range of configuration options to suit any taste. The
menu system is flexible, providing easy access to applications, theme
selection, documentation, settings, and background selection.
Enlightenment DR16 integrates well with other desktop environments, such
as Gnome, KDE, and LXDE. Replace the default window managers with E16
and you'll have the power to leverage the best of those desktop
environments, while at the same time enjoying the superior windowing
interface that Enlightenment provides.

To disable building and installing the core themes or the E-docs, set
$THEMES (for themes) or $DOCS (for documentation) to anything other than
"YES". This SlackBuild does not install Epplets, or the key- or
menu-editing packages.
