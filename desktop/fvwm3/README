Fvwm3 is the newest version of the fvwm window manager, the successor to
fvwm2.

Fvwm3 is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager, originally (a
looooong time ago!) derived from twm.

Fvwm3 is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature
set, be extremely customizable and extendible, and have a high degree of
Motif mwm compatibility.

This package does not conflict with the stock fvwm package.

Manpages for fvwm3 modules were moved as follows:
FvwmAnimate --> Fvwm3Animate
FvwmAuto --> Fvwm3Auto
...

google-go-lang is needed only at build time.
