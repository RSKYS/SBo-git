Fvwm95 (window manager for X11 with familiar look and feel)

Fvwm95 is a hack based on fvwm2. It tries to emulate the good
features of a well known product without bloating the regular fvwm
code.

Source code is patched a bit, just to make compilation under modern
versions of Slackware possible.

Manpages were moved to avoid collision with fvwm, e.g. if you want
to read documentation for FvwmTaskBar module, type:

  man Fvwm95TaskBar

xpmroot was renamed to xpmroot95 to avoid collision with fvwm.
