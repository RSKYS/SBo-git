Grits is a Virtual Globe library developed along side AWeather, 
but desigend to be usable by other program as well. It is 
differentiated from other Virtual Globes such as Google Earth, 
NASA World Wind, and KDE Marble in that it is developed primairily 
as a library that is used by other programs, such as AWeather, 
rather than providing it's own user interface.
