gRun is a GTK based Run dialog that closely resembles the Windows Run
dialog, just like xexec. It has a intelligent history mechanism and a
dual level fork() mechanism for launching the application in its own
process. gRun also has support for launching console mode application
in an XTerm as well as associations for file types.
