herbstluftwm is a manual tiling manager for X11, using Xlib and Glib.
Layout is based on splitting frames into sub-frames, similar to i3 and
musca.  Tags/workspaces can be removed or added at run-time and each
monitor displays exactly one tag at a time.

Configuration is achieved through bash scripting in the file
~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart.  An example autostart file is located
in /etc/xdg/herbstluftwm/ along with example scripts for use with the
WM.  Additional examples are available at https://www.herbstluftwm.org/
along with detailed documentation.
