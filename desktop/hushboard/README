Never listen to the thundering sounds of someone typing on a video
call ever again!

Well, nobody who talks to you will have to listen to it. If you
don’t want to listen to it either, encourage your friends and
colleagues to install Hushboard. While you’re typing, your mic is
muted. When you stop, it unmutes again.
