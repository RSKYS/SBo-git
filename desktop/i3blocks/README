i3blocks (A flexible scheduler for your i3bar blocks)

i3blocks is a highly flexible status line for the i3 window manager.
It handles clicks, signals and language-agnostic user scripts. The 
content of each block (e.g. time, battery status, network state, ...)
is the output of a command provided by the user. Blocks are updated 
on click, at a given interval of time or on a given signal, 
also specified by the user.
