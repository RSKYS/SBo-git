i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock.

This SlackBuild patches i3lock to not to use PAM, and is as such
usable in Slackware.  For verifying the password it uses shadow
instead. Because of that, it needs suid permissions, but those
privileges are dropped as soon as possible.  The code for this was
taken from slock. See the patch and LICENSE-slock.
