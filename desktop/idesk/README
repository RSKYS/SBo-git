idesk (draws desktop icons on X root window)

Idesk is program that draws desktop icons. Each icon will execute a
shell command on a configurable action. The icons can be moved on the
desktop by dragging them, and the icons will remember their positions
on start-up.

Before idesk can be started, it requires a config file in
~/.ideskrc. See the README and examples/ in /usr/doc/idesk-$VERSION.
