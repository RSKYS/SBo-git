j4-dmenu-desktop (dmenu menu generator)

j4-dmenu-desktop is a replacement for i3-dmenu-desktop. Its purpose
is to find .desktop files and offer you a menu to start an application
using dmenu.

When j4-dmenu-desktop starts an application that runs in a terminal,
by default it uses i3-sensible-terminal if it's installed on the
build host, or xterm if not. If you'd rather use a different terminal
emulator, set TERMINAL in the script's environment. Example:

# TERMINAL=urxvt ./j4-dmenu-desktop.SlackBuild
