jgmenu is a stand-alone, simple and contemporary-looking menu
application for Linux and BSD.

Although it was originally written to be used with openbox and
tint2, it is not in any way dependent on these and runs well
with other panels and window managers.

NOTE: A Composite Manager such as compton is required to enable
transparency.
