This little GUI tool is intended to set your screen brightness,
contrast and gamma levels for each color channel. It is implemented as
a front-end to xcalib, a command line utility. It will also display
the actual xcalib command line, suitable for copy-pasting to a script
to run and activate automatically on login your desired settings.
