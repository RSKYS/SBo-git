lemonbar-xft (lightweight taskbar based on XCB)

lemonbar-xft (formerly known as bar) is a lightweight taskbar entirely
based on XCB. This is a fork that supports fontconfig. Provides full
UTF-8 support, basic formatting, RandR and Xinerama support, and EWMH
compliance without wasting your precious memory.

The executable is called "lemonbar", not "lemonbar-xft".
