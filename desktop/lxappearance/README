LXAppearance is the standard theme switcher of LXDE. Users are able to
change the theme, icons, and fonts used by applications easily.

If you want to build this without dbus support (ex. you are building
not to use this inside of LXDE) pass to the script the switch:

        DBUS=no

If you want to build this for GTK+3, pass to the script the switch

        GTK3=yes
