LXHotkey allows viewing and changing global keyboard shortcuts for
the Openbox window manager actions, including those for starting
applications.

Note: upstream default is not to build the GTK GUI, this may be
overridden by passing either GTK=2 or GTK=3 to the script, e.g.
  GTK=2 ./lxhotkey.SlackBuild
