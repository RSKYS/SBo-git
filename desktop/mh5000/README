A more better background image setter

is a background image setter. Just not any ole background setter,
like all the others. It is a command line based utility where users
who want to set a background image with maybe a bit more flar then
other command line background image setters do. It can do so.

Yes, it can still do the plain ole' background settings, or it can set
one image at whatever size given as well as. It also has the ability
to change the image at a given time interval. Depending on the commands
choosen it can keep the same image while changing the color(s) or vice
versa. Even display a multitude of colors, with or without an image.
Along with many other options.
