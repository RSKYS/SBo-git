moka-icon-theme (gnome icon theme)

Moka is a stylized FreeDesktop icon set, created with simplicity in
mind.

Moka was created with minimal, flat style, using simple geometry &
colours. Each icon has been pixel-perfectly-designed and for the best
experience throughout the desktop.

Moka is only a set of application icons, it relies on its companion icon
set "Faba Icon Theme".

From Faba Icon Theme, Moka inherits all the system icons, folders,
panel icons, etc. to make a complete experience.
