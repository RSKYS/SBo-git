UTILITIES FOR EMWM
==================
xmsm is simple session manager that provides session configuration and
screen locking and also launches the window manager and the toolbox.

xmtoolbox is an application launcher/menu configured with a simple
text file.
It also communicates with the session manager to provide lock, log out,
and shutdown commands.

NOTES
=======================
The session manager may be run from XDM by setting the
DisplayManager*session X resource in xdm-config to xmsession, or by
execing xmsm from ~/.Xprofile.
Just make sure to test whether it works by running 'xinit xmsession'
before doing any of the above. Note that 'xmsession' is just a shell
script that sets up the environment for xmsm, and is not needed when
this has been done already.
-
xmsm is installed suid root, this is required for screen locking and
running sbin commands. Privileges are dropped at startup and are
reacquired only when necessary.
-
System shutdown, reboot and suspend commands can be altered at compile
time only. Edit constants in smconf.h, or override them in CFLAGS if
necessary.

copy /etc/X11/toolboxrc to  ~/.toolboxrc for per-user configuration
