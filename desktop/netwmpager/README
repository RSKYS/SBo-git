netwmpager is an enhanced version of the original netwmpager-1.11 
program written around 2005 by Timo Hirvonen. It should be compliant
with the EWMH (or NetWM) specifications. This version implements 
virtual desktops split into different viewports, into different 
desks, or both, while the earlier version only supported desks. As a 
consequence, netwmpager-2 should work with most window managers. It 
also has many parametrizable features, and it implements a convenient 
zoom.
