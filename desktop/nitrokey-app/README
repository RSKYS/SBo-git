Nitrokey-app is the official open-source desktop application for the
Nitrokey Pro and Storage security tokens.

It sits on the system tray and allows you to configure TOTP and HOTP
slots, TOTP interval and change the user/admin PIN for the token. Also
it provides access to the token's internal password vault, so you can
save up to 16 password on the token itself.

It ships with the udev rule to setup the USB token.

Remove the old nitrokey-app first before atempting to compile,
otherwise it will try to use the old libnitrokey from your previous
installed version and not build a new libnitrokey.
