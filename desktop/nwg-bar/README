nwg-bar (GTK3-based button bar for wlroots-based compositors)

The nwg-bar command creates a button bar on the basis of a JSON
template placed in the ~/.config/nwg-bar/ folder. By default the
command displays a horizontal bar in the center of the screen. Use
command line arguments to change the placement.
