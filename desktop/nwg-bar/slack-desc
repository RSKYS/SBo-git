# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

nwg-bar: The nwg-bar command creates a button bar on the basis of a JSON
nwg-bar: template placed in the ~/.config/nwg-bar/ folder. By default the
nwg-bar: command displays a horizontal bar in the center of the screen. Use
nwg-bar: command line arguments to change the placement.
