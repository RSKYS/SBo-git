nwg-drawer (Application drawer for sway Wayland compositor)

Nwg-drawer is a golang replacement to the nwggrid command (a part of
nwg-launchers). It's being developed with sway in mind, but should
also work with other wlroots-based Wayland compositors. X11 is not
officially supported, but you should be able to use the drawer on
some floating window managers (tested on Openbox).

Optional dependencies: "alacritty" to open .desktop files with
'Terminal=true' set within, and "Thunar" to open files/folders.
