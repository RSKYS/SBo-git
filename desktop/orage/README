Orage is a time-managing application for the Xfce desktop environment.

Orage aims to be a fast and easy to use graphical calendar. 
It uses portable ical format and includes common calendar features like 
repeating appointments and multiple alarming possibilities.
Orage does not have group calendar features, but can only be used for 
single user. 
It takes a list of files for ical files that should be imported.
Contents of those files are read and converted into Orage, but those 
files are left untouched.
