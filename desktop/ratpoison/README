Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no rodent dependence. It
is largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in the
virtual terminal market.  The screen can be split into non-overlapping
frames. All windows are kept maximized inside their frames to take full
advantage of your precious screen real estate.  All interaction with
the window manager is done through keystrokes.
