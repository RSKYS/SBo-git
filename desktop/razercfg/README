This is the next generation Razer device configuration tool bringing
the Razer gaming experience to the free OpenSource world.

This utility is a replacement for the old deathaddercfg tool.

The tool architecture is based on "razerd", which is a background
daemon doing all of the lowlevel privileged hardware accesses. The user
interface tools are "razercfg", a commandline tool; and "qrazercfg",
a QT4 based graphical device configuration tool.
