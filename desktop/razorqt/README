Razorqt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment
based on Qt technologies. It has been tailored for users who
value simplicity, speed, and intuitive interface. Unlike desktop
environments, Razorqt also works fine with weak machines.

Razorqt does not include a window manager.  While it can use fvwm2
or kwin (included with Slackware), openbox is most often used by the
upstream developers (and the one found most appealing here), so it is
strongly recommended.

*NOTE* This has been superseded by LXQt since some years and it's not
maintained anymore.
