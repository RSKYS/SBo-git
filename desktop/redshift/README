redshift (screen colour adjuster)

Redshift adjusts the colour temperature of your screen according to
your surroundings. This may help your eyes if you are working in front
of the screen at night.

This package has a dependency on geoclue2, however it will compile the
package without it if geoclue2 is not present.
