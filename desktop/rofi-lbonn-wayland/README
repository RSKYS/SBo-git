Rofi-lbonn-wayland is a rofi fork which is  is a window switcher, 
application launcher and dmenu replacement.

Rofi-wayland, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of 
options where one or more can be selected. This can either be running 
an application, selecting a window, or options provided by an external
script.
Rofi-wayland is a fork of Rofi by lbonn with wayland support.
Rofi started as a clone of simpleswitcher, written by Sean Pringle -
a popup window switcher roughly based on superswitcher. Simpleswitcher
laid the foundations, and therefore Sean Pringle deserves most of the
credit for this tool. Rofi (renamed, as it lost the simple property)
has been extended with extra features, like an application launcher
and ssh-launcher, and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making
it a very versatile tool.

if you want only wayland support and not X11 edit the slackbuild and
change -Dxcb=enabled to disabled.
