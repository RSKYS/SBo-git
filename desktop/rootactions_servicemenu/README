Root Actions servicemenu provides a convenient way to perform
several actions 'as root', from the right-click context menu in KDE
filemanagers.

Included in the download are .desktop file versions for KDE3 konqueror,
KDE3 dolphin, KDE4 (both konqueror and dolphin), and an importable
user action xml file for krusader KDE4.  See README in source files for
details.

This build script installs the KDE4/Dolphin version.
