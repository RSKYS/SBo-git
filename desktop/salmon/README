salmon (afterstep-style load monitor applet)

A resource utilization monitor that can display the current load
averages, the amount of free or used memory and swap space, memory
in cache, buffers, and shared, number of processes, the load split
between user, nice, system, and idle, the uptime, the current local
time, the current universal time, the name of the local host and the
phase of the moon.

Although salmon was designed for use with AfterStep and WindowMaker,
it works fine in other environments.
