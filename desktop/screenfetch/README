screenfetch (bash screenshot information tool)

Screenfetch  is  a Bash Screenshot Information Tool.  This handy Bash
script  can be  used to generate  one of  those nifty  terminal theme
information  + ASCII   distribution   logos  you  see  in  everyone's
screenshots  nowadays.  It  will  auto-detect  your  distribution and
display  an  ASCII  version  of  that  distribution's  logo  and some
valuable information to the right.

scrot  is  an  optional  dependency. Without it you won't be able  to
use  -s  option  (take a screenshot).  You  can also specify a custom
screenshot command.
