Displays a icon to control xscreensaver.

This small daemon serves two basic functions:
- provides a GTK status-bar icon with one-click enabling and
  disabling of the screensaver.
- attempts to set an Away message in pidgin when the screensaver
  locks the screen and reverts to previous status message on unlock.
