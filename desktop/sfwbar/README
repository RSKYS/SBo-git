SFWBar (Sway Floating Window Bar) is a flexible taskbar application for
wayland compositors, designed with a stacking layout in mind. Originally
developed for Sway, SFWBar will work with other wayland compositors
supporting layer shell protocol, and the taskbar functionality shall 
work with any compositor supportinig foreign toplevel protocol, but the
pager, switcher and placement functionality requires sway
(or at least i3 IPC support).

SFWBar implements the following features:
• Taskbar - to control floating windows
• Task Switcher - to allow switching active window with a keyboard 
  (Alt-Tab)
• Pager - to allow switching between workspaces
• Tray - a systm tray using status notification item protocol
• Window placement engine - to open new windows in more logical 
  locations
• A simple widget set to display information from system files

CONFIGURATION:
Copy sfwbar.config from /usr/share/sfwbar/ to ~/.config/sfwbar/
For more information on the format of configuration file, please see the
man page

you may want to add the following lines to your sway config file to open
windows as floating by default:
# open new windows as floating by default
for_window [app_id="[.]*"] floating enable
# set Alt-tab as a task switcher combo
bindsym Alt+Tab bar hidden_state toggle
# set $mod+c to hide/unhide taskbar
bindsym $mod+c bar mode toggle
