Skulpture is a GUI style addon for KDE programs. It features a classical
three-dimensional artwork with shadows and smooth gradients to enhance
the visual experience. Skulpture has been designed to be light and easy
on the eyes; many distracting borders or graphical elements have been
removed or replaced by simpler artwork (see NOTES and README for
additional information). Skulpture includes a kwin decoration as well as
a GUI style. 

As a KDE style, Skulpture depends on KDE4, part of a default Slackware
installation.
