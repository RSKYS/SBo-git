sl-fortune (a fortune notification in X with a slack-ish icon)

sl-fortune (Slack Fortune) calls fortune and sends the output to
your desktop via notify-send. Three slack-themed icons are provided.

When run as root the icon can be set to one of {tux, bob, slk}.
#sl-fortune bob

sl-fortune can autostart if a user runs it with the --install flag.
$sl-fortune -i

Upon installation it has a random delay, accessible when run with -r
$sl-fortune -r

To disable, remove the -r flag in ~/.config/autostart/sl-fortune.desktop
