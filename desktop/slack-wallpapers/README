This contains a collection of over 700 Slackware-dedicated and/or
otherwise related wallpapers.

The images are placed in /usr/share/wallpapers and will be shown in
the KDE wallpaper chooser. Also, xscreensaver will automatically find
them there and use the images for screensavers like "Carousel".

There are three options:
The SlackBuild can create symlinks for the background choosers of XFCE
or MATE or both, and also optionally add background images for LiLo.

MATE=yes Add symlinks for the MATE Desktop
XFCE=yes Add symlinks for the XFCE Desktop
LILO=yes Add background images for LiLo.

Note about LiLo backgrounds;
LiLo backgrounds require that you edit your /etc/lilo.conf. The
settings for each background is in /boot/images named the same as the
image but with a .txt extension. Make sure that you run lilo after
editing your lilo.conf!

To track all the authors would be quite troublesome or impossible.
Therefore if someone recognised their work and (rightfully) wants to
be credited, please let me know!
