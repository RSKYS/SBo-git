Spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11. It tries
to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be
used for much more important stuff. It has sane defaults and does
not require one to learn a language to do any configuration. It was
written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact
and fast.

NOTES:
The installer includes several example files, including:
* baraction.sh (scripts for the status bar in Linux)
* spectrwm.conf (a default configuration file)
* spectrwm_$LANGUAGE.conf (language-specfic keyboard layouts)

All these files can be found in /usr/doc/spectrwm-$VERSION/examples

The installer places a default spectrwm.conf in /etc but spectrwm will
also look for .spectrwm.conf and .spectrwm_us.conf in $HOME/user/

baraction.sh can go in an executable path which should be named in
.spectrwm.conf

Finally, dmenu is a soft dependency, and spectrwm will give a warning
if it's missing. However it's not essential and some users may prefer
other app launchers.
