spectrwm_baraction.sh is the main script that can be set as the value for the
bar_action option in spectrwm.conf.
You can install it in your PATH and configure it like this (the values are just
examples):
bar_enabled  = 1
bar_font  = -*-terminus-medium-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
bar_action  = spectrwm_baraction.sh

This script uses the following utilities:
o top(1) - installed on Slackware
o free(1) - installed on Slackware
o setxkbmap(1) - installed on Slackware
o skb(1) - optional, can be used for alternative keyboard layout detection
o battery_status.sh - optional
  Needs the power_supply class in the /sys directory.
o wifi_link_quality.sh - optional
  Needs ip(8) from the iproute2 package and iwconfig(8) from the
  wireless-tools package (both of which is installed on Slackware).


spectrwm_screenshot.sh:
This makes a screenshot of the whole X11 screen or optionally just a window.
It needs the ImageMagick (included in Slackware) or GraphicsMagick (available
from the SBo repository) package's `import` utility.
You can configure it in your spectrwm.conf like this:
program[capture]  = spectrwm_screenshot.sh full
bind[capture]    = MOD+c
program[capture_w]  = spectrwm_screenshot.sh window
bind[capture_w]    = MOD+Shift+c


Needless to say, that these scripts must be in your PATH in the above cases.
