subtle (ruby based tiling WM)

A grid-based manual tiling window manager with a strong focus on
easy but customizable look and feel
Subtle has a rather uncommon approach of tiling: Per default there is
no typical layout enforcement, windows are placed on a position
(gravity) in a custom grid. The user can change the gravity of each
window either directly per grabs or with rules defined by tags
in the config.
