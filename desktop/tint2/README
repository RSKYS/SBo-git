Tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar made for modern X window managers.
It was specifically made for Openbox but it should also
work with other window managers.

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with lightweight code
and compliance with freedesktop specifications.

Features panel with taskbar, system tray, clock and launcher icons.
Easy to customize: color/transparency on fonts, icons, borders
and backgrounds.

On the first run, /etc/xdg/tint2/tint2rc is copied to
~/.config/tint2/tint2rc and used as the default configuration.
