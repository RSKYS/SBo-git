unsaver (deactivate screensaver on joystick or fullscreen activity)

unsaver lets you play games with your joysticks/gamepads and watch
fullscreen videos without your screensaver activating due to lack of
keyboard/mouse input.

unsaver should be started from your .xinitrc or whatever X startup
script your window manager or desktop environment uses.
