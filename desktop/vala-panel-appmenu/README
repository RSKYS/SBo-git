Vala Panel Application Menu is a Global Menu applet for use with 
Vala Panel, xfce4-panel and mate-panel (Budgie 10.x is also planned).

Requires bamf must be built without   --disable-introspection

xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/ShellShowsMenubar -n -t bool -s true 
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Gtk/ShellShowsAppmenu -n -t bool -s true
