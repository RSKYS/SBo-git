Variety changes the desktop wallpaper on a regular basis, using
user-specified or automatically downloaded images.

Variety sits conveniently as an indicator in the panel and can be easily
paused and resumed. The mouse wheel can be used to scroll wallpapers
back and forth until you find the perfect one for your current mood.

Apart from displaying images from local folders, several different
online sources can be used to fetch wallpapers according to
user-specified criteria.

Variety can also automatically apply various fancy filters to the
displayed images - charcoal painting, oil painting, heavy blurring, etc.
- so that your desktop is always fresh and unique. Applying a heavy
blurring filter for example is a great way to get abstract-looking and
unobtrusive, yet colorful wallpapers, similar in spirit to the default
one in Ubuntu.

Variety was developed by Peter Levi as part of the Ubuntu App Showdown,
June-July 2012
