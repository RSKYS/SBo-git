VTWM, one of many TWM descendants, implements a Virtual Desktop (VD), 
meaning that what is currently on screen is just a portion of a larger 
workspace. What portion of the virtual desktop that is displayed, and 
whatever windows might be visible within it, are simple point-and-click 
operations within a scaled representation of the workspace.
