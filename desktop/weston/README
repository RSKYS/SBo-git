Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, as well
as a useful environment in and of itself.

Out of the box, Weston provides a very basic desktop, or a full-featured
environment for non-desktop uses such as automotive, embedded,
in-flight, industrial, kiosks, set-top boxes and TVs. It also provides a
library allowing other projects to build their own full-featured
environments on top of Weston's core.

A small suite of example or demo clients are also provided: though they
can be useful in themselves, their main purpose is to be an example or
test case for others building compositors or clients.
