wf-shell is a repository which contains the various components needed
to built a fully functional DE based around wayfire. 
Currently it has only a GTK-based panel and background client.

To configure the panel and the dock, wf-shell uses a config file located
(by default) in ~/.config/wf-shell.ini An example configuration
can be found in the file wf-shell.ini.example, alongside with comments
what each option does.
