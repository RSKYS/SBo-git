wmcellauto (Window Maker dockapp for displaying cellular automata)

wmcellauto is a cellular automata simulator which runs in a 64x64
window, intended to be used with the WindowMaker dock (though it will
run in any window manager).

The default cellular automata type is the classic Conway's Life, but
quite a few other types are supported.
