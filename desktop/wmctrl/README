wmctrl is a command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible
X Window Manager.

The wmctrl program is a command line tool to interact with an EWMH /
NetWM compatible X Window Manager. It provides command line access
to almost all of the features defined in the EWMH specification. It's
possible to, for example, obtain information about the window manager,
get a detailed list of desktops and managed windows, switch and resize
desktops, change the number of desktops, make windows full-screen,
always-above, or sticky, and activate, close, move, resize, maximize,
and minimize them. The command line access makes it easy to automate
these tasks and execute them from any application that is able to run a
command in response to some event.
