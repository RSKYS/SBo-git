wmcube is a dockapp displaying a realtime rotating 3D object (plugin)
together with the current CPU load.  The speed of the rotation
depends on the CPU load.  You may choose between seven color schemes
including default monochrome one.

The program includes a collection of the plugins including three
Slackware logos.
