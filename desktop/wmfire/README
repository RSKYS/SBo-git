wmfire is a system load monitor applet.

It can monitor the average cpu load, or individual cpu load on SMP
computers.  Additionally it can monitor the memory, network load, a
file or just be set to show a pretty flame. On entering the dock a
burning spot replaces the cursor, and after two seconds symbols to
represent the current monitor are "burnt" onscreen. The flame colour
can also be changed.
