The last clock dockapp you'll ever need! Features sexy gradient
background, antialiased clock hands, alpha-blended bubbles, and cool
fish swimming around behind the clock. Displays current time with
up-to-the-second accuracy, and today's date and day of the week.

But wait, there is more! Move your mouse inside the screen, and the
fish will get scared and run away! (Only if your Window Manager doesn't
suck). Oh yeah, and it checks your mail, too!
