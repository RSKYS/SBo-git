wmii - window manager improved 2

wmii is a dynamic window manager for X11. It supports classic and
dynamic window management with extended keyboard, mouse, and filesystem
based remote control. It replaces the workspace paradigm with a new
tagging approach. Its minimalist philosophy attempts to not exceed
10.000 lines of code (including all shipped utilities and libraries),
to enforce simplicity and clarity.

If you plan to use plan9port, python or ruby scripting support you
should also install required interpreters at run time.
