# Sample rc file for wmmon

# Syntax is simple: each line may be a comment introduced with # (like this
# line), blank, or "[button_name]: [command]", where the [button_name] is
# one of "left", "middle", "right", and [command] is the command to be
# executed when that button is clicked, on the dockapp. The commands
# are searched for in the PATH, if they're not given as absolute paths.

# left: xterm
# middle: xload
right: xterm -e top
