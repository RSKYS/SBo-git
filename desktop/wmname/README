wmname prints/sets the window manager name property of the root window
similar to how hostname(1) behaves.

wmname is a nice utility to fix problems with JDK versions and other
broken programs assuming a reparenting window manager for instance.

Run 'wmname' to print the current WM name. Run 'wmname <name>' to
set it.  This is pretty much similiar to hostname(1).
