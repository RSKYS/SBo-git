wmnet (network bandwidth monitor dockapp for WindowMaker)

wmnet polls network statistics and does a few things with the data it
gets. It has small blinking lights for the RX and TX of IP packets,
a digital speedometer of your network's current speed, and a bar graph
(like xload) plotting your throughput.

Note: wmnet still works on modern Linux systems, but all the
documentation about ipfwadm and ipchains is hopelessly outdated.
