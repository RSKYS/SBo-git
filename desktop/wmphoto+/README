wmphoto+ (image viewing dockapp for windowmaker)

wmphoto+ displays the images in the dockable application window.
You can switch the images manually or display them as a slide show.
Each image accepts up to two related commands.  You can run them
using mouse buttons when the application displays the image.  Using

of the program which display the different sets of the images.
