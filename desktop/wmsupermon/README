wmsupermon (universal monitoring dockapp for WindowMaker)

wmsupermon is a highly configurable dockapp that can monitor almost any
system statistic you can think of.

Examples:

 1. CPU usage
 2. disk i/o
 3. memory
 4. swap
 5. filesystems - space utilization
 6. network traffic
 7. wireless link quality
 8. CPU frequency
 9. CPU temperature, fan speed, voltages (no lm_sensors required!)
10. battery status (with actual - not guessed - discharge rate!)
11. traffic from your router
12. anything else :)

The dockapp is configured via ~/.wmsupermonrc file, which specifies what
to monitor and how to present the results.

*** NOTE: Installing this package does NOT create a config file.
You will have to create one before the dockapp will start. See README
and example-wmsupermonrc in /usr/doc/wmsupermon-1.2.2 for details.
