wmtime (time dockapp for WindowMaker)

WMTime, guess what, displays the time and date and gives you
some nice additional features too...

If you're upgrading from a previous version of wmtime and wonder what
happened to the locale support: wmtime now uses the system's locales
for the days of the week and month names. It supports more languages
than it did before, and respects LANG in the environment.
