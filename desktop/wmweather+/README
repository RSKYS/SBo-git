wmweather+ (Weather Monitor DockApp)

wmweather+ will download the National Weather Serivce METAR bulletins;
AVN, ETA, and MRF forecasts; and any weather map for display in a
WindowMaker dockapp. Think wmweather with a smaller font, forecasts,
a weather map, and a sky condition display.

Note: This requires a config file, either /etc/wmweather+.conf or
~/.wmweather+/conf, which is used to set your geographical location.
See /usr/doc/wmweather+-$VERSION/example.conf and read "man
wmweather+" for details.
