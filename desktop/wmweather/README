wmweather is Window Maker weather monitor dockable application

wmweather monitors local weather conditions: temperature, dew point,
pressure, humidity and wind direction and speed. The user needs to
specify a 4-character `ICAO location indicator'. The standardized
METAR station designations and current weather reports are designed
for use by the aviation community. Since most major cities have at
least one airport, there is usually one or more METAR stations in a
given city.
