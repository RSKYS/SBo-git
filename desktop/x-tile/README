X-tile is an application that allows you to select a number of windows
and tile them in different ways.

X-tile works on any X desktop (gnome, kde, xfce, lxde?).

The main features are: many tiling geometries, undo tiling, invert
tiling order, optional system tray docking and menu, filter to avoid
listing some windows, filter to check some windows by default, command
line interface.
