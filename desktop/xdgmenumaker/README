xdgmenumaker (application menu generator for window managers)

xdgmenumaker is a command line tool, written in python, that generates
application menus using xdg information, by scanning *.desktop files in
all $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications directories. All applications are sorted
according to the main categories as specified by freedesktop.org. The
menu entries that are generated by xdgmenumaker are localised according
to the running user locale settings.

xdgmenumaker currently supports generating menus for blackbox,
compizboxmenu, fluxbox, fvwm, icewm, jwm, pekwm, twm (and compatible
derivatives such as ctwm and vtwm), and windowmaker.
