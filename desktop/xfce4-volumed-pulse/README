This daemon is responsible of making the volume up/down and mute keys
of the keyboard work automatically, and uses PulseAudio for choosing
which card/sink/track to act on. It also provides volume change and
mute toggle notifications if a notification daemon is running.

This is a fork of the original xfce4-volumed to drop GStreamer support
and use PulseAudio instead.
