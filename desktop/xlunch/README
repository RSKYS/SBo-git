xlunch (graphical launcher for xorg/x11)

Xlunch is a small and simple graphical launcher for Xorg/X11. It
requires only pure Xlib and Imlib2. It allows you to run a program by
clicking its icon; alternatively, you can also just type any arbitrary
command using your keyboard. It is possible to run xlunch in two
different modes: Desktop mode and Quick launch mode.
