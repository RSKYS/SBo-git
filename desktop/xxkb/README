The xxkb program is a keyboard layout switcher and indicator. Unlike
the programs that reload keyboard maps and use their own hot-keys,
xxkb is a simple GUI for XKB (X KeyBoard extension) and just sends
commands to and accepts events from XKB. That means that it will work
with the existing setup of your X Server without any modifications.
