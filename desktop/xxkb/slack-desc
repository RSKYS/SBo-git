# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xxkb: xxkb (simple X keyboard layout switcher)
xxkb:
xxkb: The xxkb program is a keyboard layout switcher and indicator. Unlike
xxkb: the programs that reload keyboard maps and use their own hot-keys,
xxkb: xxkb is a simple GUI for XKB (X KeyBoard extension) and just sends
xxkb: commands to and accepts events from XKB. That means that it will work
xxkb: with the existing setup of your X Server without any modifications.
