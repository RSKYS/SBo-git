# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

yad: Yad (yet another dialog) is a fork of Zenity with many improvements,
yad: including custom buttons, additional dialogs and a pop-up menu in
yad: the notification area.
yad: There were two main reasons for this fork.  The first was to remove
yad: dependencies on deprecated libraries like libglade and gnome-canvas.
yad: The second was the slow pace of Zenity development including many
yad: unimplemented enhancement suggestions in the GNOME Bugzilla.
