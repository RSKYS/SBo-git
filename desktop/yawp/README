yaWP (Yet Another Weather Plasmoid) is for the KDE 4.x panel that shows
the current weather and forecast.  This SlackBuild includes the base
plasmoid.  Additional themes are available at KDE-Look.

yaWP works with several different weather sources.  You can configure
it to show up to 5 days weather forecast and display the current
satellite image.  It is also possible to keep track of multiple cities.
