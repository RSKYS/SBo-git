Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also
provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.

Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural.
Test names do not have to be valid identifiers, assertions look like
normal C++ boolean expressions, and sections provide a nice and local
way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests.

Catch2 builds the v3 branch of Catch2.
This package conflicts with Catch.
