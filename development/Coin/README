Coin is a high-level 3D graphics toolkit for developing cross-platform
real-time 3D visualization and visual simulation software.

Coin is built on OpenGL and uses scene graph data structures to render
3D graphics in real-time.  Basic import, rendering, and interaction
with a 3D object can be implemented in just a few lines of code, and
programmer efficiency is greatly increased compared with programming
directly with OpenGL.  OpenGL code and Coin code can co-exist in the
same application, which makes gradual migration from OpenGL to Coin
possible.

Coin is fully compatible with SGI Open Inventor 2.1, the de facto
standard for 3D visualization and visual simulation software in the
scientific and engineering community.  Additional features in Coin
include VRML97 support, 3D sound, 3D textures, and parallel rendering
on multiple processors.
