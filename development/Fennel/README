Fennel is a programming language that brings together the speed,
simplicity, and reach of Lua with the flexibility of a lisp syntax and
macro system.

* Full Lua compatibilty: Easily call any Lua function or library from
  Fennel and vice-versa.
* Zero overhead: Compiled code should be just as or more efficient
  than hand-written Lua.
* Compile-time macros: Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency
  on Fennel.
* Embeddable: Fennel is a one-file library as well as an executable.
  Embed it in other programs to support runtime extensibility
  and interactive development.

Anywhere you can run Lua code, you can run Fennel code.

This requires one or more versions of Lua installed: lua, lua51, luajit.
Default: support for all versions of Lua installed at build time.
To specify which Lua versions:
  export LUAVER="vers"

"vers" must be one or more of "5.1 5.4 jit", separated with spaces.

After installation, there are one or more fennel executable files for
the equivalent versions of Lua.

Optional dependency:
* lua-readline
For history completion
