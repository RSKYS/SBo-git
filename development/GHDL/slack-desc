# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

GHDL:  GHDL is an open-source simulator for the VHDL language. GHDL allows
GHDL: you to compile and execute your VHDL code directly in your PC.
GHDL:  GHDL fully supports the 1987, 1993, 2002 versions of the IEEE 1076 
GHDL: VHDL standard, and partially the latest 2008 revision (well enough 
GHDL: to support fixed_generic_pkg or float_generic_pkg).
