JSON wrapper for boost property tree. Easy to use JSON library
based on the API of the Java JSON.org one
(http://www.json.org/java/index.html).

The main focus of the library is to be easy to use and use the
less amount of dependencies possible. This library only requires
boost property tree, boost reges and boost thread to be used.
