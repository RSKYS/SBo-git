Mk4tcl - Tcl binding for Metakit embedded database library

Metakit is an efficient embedded database library with a small
footprint.  It fills the gap between flat-file, relational,
object-oriented, and tree-structured databases, supporting
relational joins, serialization, nested structures, and instant schema
evolution. There is a C++ API, a Python binding called Mk4py, and a Tcl
binding called Mk4tcl.  You can manipulate and exchange data between
any of these.

Data files are portable. The library has been used on Unix, Windows,
Macintosh, VMS, and others, spanning a range of 16- to 64-bit
architectures, from PDA's to S390's.

Metakit is in use in various commercial projects and products on
millions of desktops.
