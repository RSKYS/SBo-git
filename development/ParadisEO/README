EO is a template-based, ANSI-C++ evolutionary computation library which
helps you to write your own stochastic optimization algorithms
insanely fast. With the help of EO, you can easily design evolutionary
algorithms that will find solutions to virtually all kind of hard
optimization problems, from continuous to combinatorial ones.
