# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ParadisEO: ParadisEO (ANSI-C++ evolutionary computation library)
ParadisEO:
ParadisEO: EO is a template-based, ANSI-C++ evolutionary computation library
ParadisEO: which helps you to write your own stochastic optimization algorithms
ParadisEO: insanely fast. With the help of EO, you can easily design
ParadisEO: evolutionary algorithms that will find solutions to virtually
ParadisEO: all kind of hard optimization problems, from continuous
ParadisEO: to combinatorial ones.
