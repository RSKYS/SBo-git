Pivy is a Python binding for Coin where the interface is implemented
using SWIG.

Pivy allows:
  * development of Coin applications in Python
  * interactive modification of Coin programs from within the Python
    interpreter at runtime
  * incorporation of Scripting Nodes into the scene graph which are
    capable of executing Python code and callback functions
