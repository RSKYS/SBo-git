Python Toolkit (ptk) is an interactive environment for python. Based
around a set of interacting tools it includes an interactive console
(with support for multiple python interpreters and GUI mainloops),
a simple python source editor, a python path manager and namespace
browser.

NOTE: If you are upgrading from previous versions the configuration
may have changed between versions, this can give strange effects with
window layouts etc. To fix any problems it is recommended to run:

PTK --clear_settings

This will clear any previously stored settings from previous versions.
Alternatively you can delete the .PTK folder in the home directory.
