STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral
configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features
for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It is based on
the ECLIPSE/CDT framework and GCC toolchain for the development,
and GDB for the debugging.

STM32CubeIDE integrates all STM32CubeMX functionalities to offer
all-in-one tool experience.

STM32CubeIDE includes build and stack analyzers that provide the user
with useful information about project status and memory requirements.

STM32CubeIDE also includes standard and advanced debugging features
including views of CPU core registers, memories, and peripheral
registers, as well as live variable watch, Serial Wire Viewer
interface, or fault analyzer.

NOTES:
1. This SlackBuild repackages the official binary installer.
2. Direct link to download the source tarball is not available.
   You need to go to the website and download the tarball manually.
3. (TODO). I haven't paid attention to J-Link udev rules and
   ST-Link Server. These have to wait for better days.
4. Remember to reload udev rules after installing/upgrading
   the package, so that you can access your debugger:

   $ /etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload
