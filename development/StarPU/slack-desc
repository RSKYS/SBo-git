# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

StarPU: StarPU (runtime system for heterogeneous multicore machines)
StarPU:
StarPU:   StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
StarPU: multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design
StarPU: efficient computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to
StarPU: implement BLAS kernels on GPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
StarPU: offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
StarPU: the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
StarPU: efficiently as possible.
