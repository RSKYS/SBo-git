# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

SystemC: SystemC (SystemC Class Library for design and verification HW/SW)
SystemC:
SystemC:   SystemC addresses the need for a system design and verification
SystemC: language that spans hardware and software. It is a language built as
SystemC: an ANSI C++ class library created for design and verification. Users
SystemC: worldwide are applying SystemC to system-level modeling, abstract
SystemC: analog/mixed-signal modeling, architectural exploration, performance
SystemC: modeling, software development, functional verification, and high-
SystemC: level synthesis. The SystemC API and its semantics are developed
SystemC: by the Accellera Systems Initiative and formally standardized
SystemC: and governed by the IEEE in the IEEE Std. 1666-2011 standard.
