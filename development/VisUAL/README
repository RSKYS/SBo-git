VisUAL has been developed as a cross-platform tool to make learning ARM
Assembly language easier. In addition to emulating a subset of the ARM
UAL instruction set, it provides visualisations of key concepts unique
to assembly language programming and therefore helps make programming
ARM assembly more accessible.

It has been designed specifically to use as a teaching tool for the
Introduction to Computer Architecture course taught at the Department
of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London.
