# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

Xdialog: Xdialog (GTK1/2 mostly-dialog-compatible UI builder)
Xdialog:
Xdialog: Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the "dialog"
Xdialog: or "cdialog" programs. It converts any terminal based program into
Xdialog: a program with an X-windows interface. The dialogs are easier to
Xdialog: see and use while adding even more functionalities (e.g. with the
Xdialog: treeview, the file selector, the edit box, the range box, the help
Xdialog: button/box). Because Xdialog uses GTK+, it will also match your
Xdialog: desktop theme.
