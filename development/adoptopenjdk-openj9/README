This is a SlackBuild to repackage OpenJDK binary from AdoptOpenJDK
community with OpenJ9 JVM.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's / jre's
that you have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the
PATH, JAVA_HOME and MANPATH variables.

After installing the package you will need to logout / reboot your
machine as it will add files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

To enable JavaFX / OpenJFX support currently you need to add
IcedTea-Web.
