# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

afl: afl (security-oriented fuzzer)
afl:
afl: American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a
afl: novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to
afl: automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new
afl: internal states in the targeted binary. This substantially improves
afl: the functional coverage for the fuzzed code. The compact synthesized
afl: corpora produced by the tool are also useful for seeding other,
afl: more labor- or resource-intensive testing regimes down the road.

afl: This package was built @WITHQEMU@ QEMU support.
