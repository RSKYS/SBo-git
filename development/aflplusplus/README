aflplusplus (enhanced fork of afl fuzzer)

afl++ is a superior fork to Google's afl - more speed, more and better
mutations, more and better instrumentation, custom module support, etc.

American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a
novel type of compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to
automatically discover clean, interesting test cases that trigger new
internal states in the targeted binary. This substantially improves
the functional coverage for the fuzzed code. The compact synthesized
corpora produced by the tool are also useful for seeding other, more
labor- or resource-intensive testing regimes down the road.

This build of aflplusplus does not include the frida, unicorn,
coresight, or nyx modes, so the afl-fuzz -O, -U, -X, -Y options won't
work.

Build option: If you need to fuzz binary-only software, aflplusplus can
be built with QEMU support. To do this, download the qemu source from:

https://slackware.uk/~urchlay/src/qemuafl-ff9de4fbeb.tar.xz

Its md5sum is 58547e2ea53b639c17a585be376b5bb7. Place it in the
SlackBuild's directory before running the script. The resulting
package will support the -Q option to afl-fuzz. An existing
installation of qemu is not required.
