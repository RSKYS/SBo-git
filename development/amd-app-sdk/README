AMD APP (formerly ATI Stream) technology is a set of advanced hardware
and software technologies that enable AMD graphics processing cores
(GPU), working in concert with the system's x86 cores (CPU), to
accelerate many applications beyond just graphics.

This is AMD's implementation of OpenCL on top of Radeon hardware. You'll
need a compatible card and recent Catalyst drivers. See 
http://developer.amd.com/sdks/AMDAPPSDK/pages/DriverCompatibility.aspx 
for a complete list of requirements.
