Apache JMeter is a Java-based load testing tool.

JMeter is pure Java application designed to load test functional
behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for
testing web applications but has since expanded to other test
functions.

The directory /usr/share/jmeter/bin contains additional scripts for
managing JMeter.

Set API_DOCS=yes to include the full documentation. This will make the
package much larger, and the standard package already includes user
documentation.
