as31 (8031/8051 cross assembler)

as31 is an assembler for the 8031 and 8051 microcontrollers. It
produces output in several different formats, including Intel hex
format and Motorola s-records.

Note: the download filename gets mangled by certain browsers and other
web clients. If the SlackBuild complains that it can't find the source,
you can force the source filename with the SRC environment variable.
