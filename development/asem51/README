ASEM-51 is a two-pass macro assembler for the Intel MCS-51
family of microcontrollers. It is running on the PC under MS-DOS,
Windows and Linux. The ASEM-51 assembly language is a rich subset
of the Intel standard that guarantees maximum compatibility with
existing 8051 assembler sources. ASEM-51 can generate two sorts of
object files: Intel-HEX format, which is directly accepted by most
EPROM programmers, and absolute OMF-51 format, which is required
for many simulators, emulators and target debuggers. Thus ASEM-51
is suitable for small and medium MCS-51-based microcontroller
projects in hobby, education and business. However, ASEM-51 has been
designed to process also very large programs!
