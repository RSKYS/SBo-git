atasm (a mostly mac/65 compatible cross-assembler)

ATasm is a 6502 command-line cross-assembler that is compatible with
the original Mac/65 macroassembler released by OSS software. Code
development can now be performed using modern editors and compiles with
lightning speed.

This build has been updated for version 1.07d (the last beta
release), but it's still possible to build 1.06 (last stable release)
by downloading the 1.06 source and setting VERSION=1.06 in the
environment.
