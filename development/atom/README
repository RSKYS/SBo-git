Atom is a Chrome-based text editor, hackable and full-featured.

Atom comes loaded with the features you've come to expect from
a modern text editor, like a file system browser, fuzzy finder for
quickly opening files, fast project-wide search and replace,
snippets, code folding and more.

To build Atom is necessary to download about 500MB of data,
which are temporarily stored in ~/.atom, which can be
deleted after building.

If you use apmd package you need rename apm tool.

Optional building features:
* Disable compiling metrics module for Google Analytics
  for people who love your privacy
  https://github.com/atom/metrics
    DISABLE_METRICS=yes|no (default: no)
* Delete temporary data cached after building package
    DELETE_CACHE=yes|no (default: no)
* Use atom with some version of electron previously
  installed in the system. This feature don't make
  a distributable binary, and you can use like as node
  script application. This requires electron
  available in SBo
    ELECTRON=yes|no (default=no)

If you need to use any option do something like:

ELECTRON=yes ./atom.SlackBuild

NOTE:
Atom may failed to build at first attempt.
Simply retry the process and it should be working.
