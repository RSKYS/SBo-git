This package contains cross compiling version of GNU binutils, which
can be used to assemble and link binaries for the AVR platform.

It includes a patch to make 'avr-size' report how much memory (RAM
and flash) is taken up by the binary image on the target processor.
(obtained from https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/32504).
