AVR8 Burn-O-Mat is a cross-platform GUI for avrdude written in Java. 
It simplifies programing and configuration of AVR microcontrollers 
with easy to use dialogs.

From author's homepage:
To burn Atmel microcontrollers with Linux you may use avrdude like I do.
But sometimes you may wish a more comfortable way to do this without
knowing hundreds of command line options and without the need of a
calculator to calculate the hex codes for the fuses. Thats why I decided
to write a graphical user interface that make it easy to read and write
fuses, EEPROM and program memory.
