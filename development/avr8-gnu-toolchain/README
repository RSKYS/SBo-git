Atmel AVR Toolchain is a collection of tools/libraries used to create
applications for AVR microcontrollers. This collection includes
compiler, assembler, linker and Standard C & math libraries.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary
distributed by Atmel. The source code is available at:
http://distribute.atmel.no/tools/opensource/Atmel-AVR-Toolchain-3.4.1/

NOTE:
Please don't use this package in parallel with avr-binutils, avr-gcc
and avr-libc packages found at SlackBuilds.org, because the files are
placed in the same directories so one will overwrite the other.

NOTE2:
After installation, you can use the "avr-man" command to browse
the AVR specific manual pages.
