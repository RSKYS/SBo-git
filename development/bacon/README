BaCon is a free  BASIC to C converter for Unix-based systems.
The following design goals were followed:
 * Must run on each Unix/Linux/BSD platform, including Mac OS X
 * Converted source code must be compilable with GCC
 * Must resemble genuine BASIC with implicit variable declarations
 * Spoken language constructs are preferred

Code converted by BaCon can be compiled by GCC, the Compaq C Compiler
or TCC. This SlackBuild uses gcc by default, you can change that with
the COMPILER variable.

Note: When a new version of BaCon is released, the downloads will
change and the md5sums won't match.
