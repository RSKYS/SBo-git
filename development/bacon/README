bacon (BASIC to C translator)

BaCon is a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems. It
intends to be a programming aid in creating tools which can be
compiled on different platforms while trying to revive the days of the
good old BASIC. BaCon can be described as a translator, a converter,
a source-to-source compiler, a transcompiler or a transpiler. It also
can be described as a very elaborate preprocessor to C.

Note: BaCon only supports its own dialect of BASIC, which does not
support line numbers. You can't use this to compile ancient code from
the 80s.

Optional dependency: fltk (autodetected). If fltk is installed at
build time, the BaCon FLTK GUI will be built instead of the TK GUI.
If you have fltk installed but prefer the TK GUI, export FLTK=no in
the script's environment.

Optional dependency: gtksourceview4 (NOT autodetected). Install this
and export GTK3=yes in the environment, to build the GTK3 GUI instead
of FLTK or TK.
