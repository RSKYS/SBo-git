bcpp (C/C++ source beautifier)

bcpp indents C/C++ source programs, replacing tabs with spaces or the
reverse. Unlike indent, it does (by design) not attempt to wrap long
statements. It supports quite a few options to control the output; see
the man page for details.

Note that bcpp looks in the current directory for bcpp.cfg, by default
(there is no system-wide config file in /etc). Two sample config files
are installed in the documentation directory. These can be used with
the -fnc option, and should be used as templates for creating your own
project-specific config files.
