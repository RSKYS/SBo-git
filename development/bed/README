bed (ncurses-based adjustable data format binary/hex editor)

Bed is a binary editor that supports editing/viewing data in a wide
variety of formats, including ASCII, unsigned and signed integers,
float, bit-flags, bit-fields, labels, EBCDIC and time_t. Different
sizes and byte orderings are possible. Data types can be used in
structures. Other data formats, filters and procedures can be defined
in plugins.

Optional dependencies: hyperscan and/or re2. These are autodetected at
build time. bed uses these for faster regular expressions searches.

Notes:

- bed starts up in ASCII input mode. Press F7 to switch to "Digit-Hex"
  entry mode. If this doesn't work, see the next note.

- bed makes extensive use of Meta key combinations and the F-keys.
  It's pretty sensitive to the terminal type and $TERM setting being
  used. See README_SBo.txt if you have trouble with the keyboard
  commands.
