blassic (BASIC interpreter)

Blassic is a classic Basic interpreter. The line numbers are
mandatory, and it has PEEK & POKE. The main goal is to execute
programs written in old interpreters, even those that use peculiar
control flow constructs or automodifiable code. However, it can be
used as a scripting language, and has some not-so-classic
instructions. It has graphics modes that are compatible with some
classic systems and user defined.

Blassic ships with many example programs, which are installed in
/usr/share/blassic/examples/

There is no documentation on the Blassic language included in the
package. Full docs can be found on http://blassic.net/

Blassic development seems to have stopped in January of 2010. This
build is for the last stable release, 0.10.3. However, there was a
'preliminary' 0.11 release, with some new features but also with
known issues. If you want to try this version, you can build it
with this script:

- Download the source:
  https://slackware.uk/~urchlay/src/blassic-0.11.0.20100121.tgz
- Check its md5sum. Should be ee81716bc75bd5d3405cb6dc8ef34615.
- Run the script with VERSION=0.11.0.20100121 in the environment.
