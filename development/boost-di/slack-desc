# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

boost-di: Dependency Injection (DI) involves passing (injecting) one or more
boost-di: dependencies (or services) to a dependent object (or client) which
boost-di: become part of the client's state. It is like the Strategy Pattern,
boost-di: except the strategy is set once, at construction. DI enables loosely
boost-di: coupled designs, which are easier to maintain and test.
