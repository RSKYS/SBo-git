bpftrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux enhanced Berkeley
Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux kernels (4.x). bpftrace
uses LLVM as a backend to compile scripts to BPF-bytecode and makes
use of BCC for interacting with the Linux BPF system, as well as
existing Linux tracing capabilities: kernel dynamic tracing (kprobes),
user-level dynamic tracing (uprobes), and tracepoints. The bpftrace
language is inspired by awk and C, and predecessor tracers such as
DTrace and SystemTap. bpftrace was created by Alastair Robertson.
