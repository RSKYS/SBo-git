# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bsdiff: bsdiff (binary diff/patch utility)
bsdiff:
bsdiff: bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to
bsdiff: binary files. By using suffix sorting (specifically, Larsson and
bsdiff: Sadakane's qsufsort) and taking advantage of how executable files
bsdiff: change, bsdiff routinely produces binary patches 50-80% smaller than
bsdiff: those produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller than those produced by
bsdiff: .RTPatch (a $2750/seat commercial patch tool).
