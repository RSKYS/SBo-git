bviplus (hex editor with vi-style user interface)

Bviplus is an ncurses based hex editor with a vim-like interface. It
was originally a fork of Binary VIsual editor (bvi) by Gerhard
Burgmann, but has now been completely rewritten (since version 0.3).

Additions include:
  - Quickly open/edit/save very large files
  - Search highlighting
  - Multiple undo/redo
  - Visual select
  - Cut/paste (works between files as well)
  - Multiple file tabbed interface
  - Run external programs on selected data
  - Blob coloring
  - And much more to come.
