.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
bviplus [ [\fIfile\fP] ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Bviplus is an ncurses based hex editor with a vim\-like interface. It
was originally a fork of Binary VIsual editor (bvi) by Gerhard
Burgmann, but has now been completely rewritten (since version 0.3).
.sp
There are no command\-line options. For usage instructions, enter
":help" from within \fBbviplus\fP\&.
.SH FILES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB~/.bviplusrc\fP
Startup script for \fBbviplus\fP, as described in the help.
.UNINDENT
.SH BUGS
.sp
Running \fBbviplus\fP with a nonexistant filename will always create the
file, even if the :w (write) command is never used. This, combined
with the fact that there are no options, may result in empty files
named things like \fI\-\-help\fP or \fI\-h\fP\&.
