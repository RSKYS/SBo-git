This is a SlackBuild that will install ccl (Clozure Common Lisp).

Ccl includes both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries (except ARM which is
currently 32-bit only). Official scripts 'ccl' and 'ccl64' will be put
on PATH, corresponding to the 32-bit and 64-bit lisp implementations
in order.  On Slackware64 with multilib installed, it's possible to
run 32-bit ccl, using 'ccl' instead of 'ccl64'.

Ccl uses low 16 bits of the address space for certain optimizations.
The Linux kernel provides a feature that can prevent a process from
mapping addresses below a certain base address to prevent exploitation
of undiscovered null pointer dereference bugs in the kernel. To make
ccl run on Slackware, 'mmap_min_addr' will be set to 4096.  (see
/etc/sysctl.d/ccl.conf)

The 4K value will protect against certain (yet-to-be-discovered) NULL
pointer deference bugs in the kernel, but will still allow
applications to use low-memory addresses.  For details see
http://trac.clozure.com/ccl/wiki/PlatformNotes

To make ccl usable before a reboot, execute the command below;
# /sbin/sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=4096
