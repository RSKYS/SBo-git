  Chameleon is a framework written in C which provides routines to
solve dense general systems of linear equations, symmetric positive
definite systems of linear equations and linear least squares
problems, using LU, Cholesky, QR and LQ factorizations. Real
arithmetic and complex arithmetic are supported in both single
precision and double precision.

  Chameleon is based on the PLASMA source code but is not limited
to shared-memory environment and can exploit multiple GPUs.
Chameleon is interfaced in a generic way with StarPU, PaRSEC,
QUARK, OpenMP runtime systems. This feature allows to analyze in
a unified framework how sequential task-based algorithms behave
regarding different runtime systems implementations. Using Chameleon
with StarPU or PaRSEC runtime systems allows to exploit GPUs through
kernels provided by cuBLAS and clusters of interconnected nodes with
distributed memory (using MPI).


The default scheduler is set to OpenMP, if you want to use the StarPU
you should set the environment variable STARPU=yes and install StarPU.

For enabling MPI set the environment variable MPI=yes, this require
a MPI implementation (openmpi or mpich).
