CHICKEN is a compiler for the Scheme programming language. It produces
portable and efficient C and supports the R5RS and R7RS (work in
progress) standards, and many extensions. It runs on Linux, OS X,
Windows, many Unix flavours, and aims to be free, simple, portable,
extensible, well documented, and actively supported.

Scheme is a member of the Lisp family of languages.
