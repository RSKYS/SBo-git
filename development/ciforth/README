lina is the Linux native (= c-less) version of ciforth (common Intel
Forth), an interpret environment and compiler for Forth. It is
(large and by) compliant with the ISO Forth standard; the CORE
wordset is fully implemented. The small, classic, indirect threaded
kernel contains the essential, i.a. file access and exceptions. Its
power is multiplied by an extensive source library, that add i.a.
a decompiler and integrated 386 assembler. It is fully self
contained; if you want to understand a compiler in all details,
this is your best, if not only, choice. ciforth sports the highest
documentation to binary proportion in the EDP industry, barring
m4 on Coherent.

For nicer command-line experience (electives loaded instantly,
history, cursor keys etc.) you may want to add the following line
to your ~/.bashrc file:

  alias lina='rlwrap lina -e'
