  Developed at NASAs Johnson Space Center from 1985 to 1996, the C
Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) is a rules-based
programming language useful for creating expert systems and other
programs where a heuristic solution is easier to implement and
maintain than an algorithmic solution. Written in C for portability,
CLIPS can be installed and used on a wide variety of platforms.
Since 1996, CLIPS has been available as public domain software.
