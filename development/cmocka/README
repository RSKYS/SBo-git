mock objects. It only requires the standard C library, works on a lot
of platforms (including embedded) and with different compilers.

of different platforms.

library, fully documented API, test fixtures, exception handling for
signals, no fork(), very well tested, testing of memory leaks, buffer
overflows and underflows.
