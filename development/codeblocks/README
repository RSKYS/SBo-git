Code::Blocks is a free C, C++ and Fortran IDE built to meet the most
demanding needs of its users. It is designed to be very extensible and
fully configurable. Finally, an IDE with all the features you need,
having a consistent look, feel and operation across platforms.

Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with
plugins. Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a
plugin. For instance, compiling and debugging functionality is already
provided by plugins!

N.B:
a) The path for plugins is now /usr/lib{,64}/codeblocks/plugins.
   Take care if upgrading from a previous version and you have already
   installed additional plugins (you might need to reinstall them).
b) All contrib-plugins are disabled by default. Invoke the script with
      $ PLUGINS=yes ./codeblocks.SlackBuild
   in order to enable all contrib-plugins in your build.
