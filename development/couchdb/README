Apache CouchDB is a RESTFul document-oriented database.
 
Apache CouchDB is a document-oriented database that can be queried 
and indexed in a MapReduce fashion using JavaScript.  CouchDB also 
offers incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection
and resolution.  CouchDB provides a RESTful JSON API.

You must have a "couchdb" user and group before running this script;
something like this should suffice:
  # groupadd -g 231 couchdb
  # useradd -u 231 -g couchdb -d /var/lib/couchdb -s /bin/sh couchdb

See README.SLACKWARE for further configuration information.
