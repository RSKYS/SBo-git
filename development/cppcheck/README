Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code. Unlike C/C++
compilers and many other analysis tools, it doesn't detect syntax
errors.  Cppcheck only detects the types of bugs that the compilers
normally fail to detect.  The goal is to have no false positives.

To supplement Cppcheck, it is recommended that you enable as many
compiler warnings as possible.  For the GCC compiler, take a look
at http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html for a
comprehensive list of warning options that GCC supports.  At a minimum,
it is recommended that you enable -Wall, -Wextra, and -pedantic

If you do not want to install the manual pages, you can run the build
script like this:  MAKEMAN=no ./cppcheck.SlackBuild
