# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cproto: variable declarations from C source code. It can also convert
cproto: function definitions between the old style and the ANSI C style.
cproto: This conversion overwrites the original files, so make a backup copy
