Cxref is a program that will produce documentation (in LaTeX, HTML,
RTF or SGML) including cross-references from C program source code.
It has been designed to work with ANSI C, incorporating K&R, and
most popular GNU extensions.

The cxref program only works for C not C++, there are no plans to
produce a C++ version.
