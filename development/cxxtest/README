CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit
to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit.  CxxTest is easy to use because it does
not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no
advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible
form of test discovery.

Package ply is an optional runtime dependency: it's needed for the FOG
C++ parser.
