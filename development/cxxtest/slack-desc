# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cxxtest: cxxtest (unit testing framework for C++)
cxxtest:
cxxtest: CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit
cxxtest: to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit.  CxxTest is easy to use because it does
cxxtest: not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no
cxxtest: advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible
cxxtest: form of test discovery.
