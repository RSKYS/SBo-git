dasm (cross assembler for 6502 and other 8-bit CPUs)

DASM is versatile macro assembler with support for several 8-bit
microprocessors including MOS 6502 & 6507; Motorola 6803, 68705, and
68HC11; Hitachi HD6303 (extended Motorola 6801) and Fairchild F8.

DASM also includes platform support for the Atari 2600, Atari 7800,
and Fairchild Channel F game consoles.

Support files are installed to /usr/share/dasm/machines; usual
practice is to copy them to your project directory, or use
e.g. -I/usr/share/dasm/machines/atari2600 to set the include path.

Also provided is "ftohex", which converts an output file in one of
the three formats to an Intel hex format suitable for many intelligent
prom programmers (e.g. GTEK).
