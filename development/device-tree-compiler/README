device-tree-compiler (Device Tree Compiler for Flat Device Trees)

Device Tree Compiler, 'dtc', transforms a textual description of
a device tree ('DTS') into a binary object ('DTB').  DTS is most 
commonly used on embedded platforms.  This tool is particularly 
useful for building a DTS-enabled 'U-Boot' binary.
