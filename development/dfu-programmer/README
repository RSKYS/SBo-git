dfu-programmer is an implementation of the Device Firmware Upgrade
class USB driver that enables firmware upgrades for various USB enabled
(with the correct bootloader) Atmel chips. This program was created
because the Atmel "FLIP" program for flashing devices does not support
flashing via USB on Linux, and because standard DFU loaders do not work
for Atmel's chips.

Check out the Atmel website for more information. They are kind enough
to provide generally correct specifications this implementation is
based on.

See README.SBo for post-install configuration.
