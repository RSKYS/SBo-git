dis (statically tracing 6502 disassembler)

dis creates XASM/MADS-compatible assembly code from a memory dump or an
executable. dis statically traces execution paths starting from code
entry points to mark which memory locations contain code. All other
memory is treated as data. dis traces through JMP, JSR and BXX branch
instructions. It stops at RTS, RTI and illegal instructions.

dis automatically determines code entry points when disassembling Atari
XEX/SAP files and Commodore 64 PRG files.

The .dop files mentioned in the documentation are installed to
"/usr/share/dis".
