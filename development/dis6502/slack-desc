# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dis6502: dis6502 is a 6502 disassembler that supports Atari 8-bit and Commodore
dis6502: executables, as well as raw memory dumps. It attempts to separate code
dis6502: sections from data by tracing the flow of execution, and supports a
dis6502: config file for manually defining code sections that aren't reached
