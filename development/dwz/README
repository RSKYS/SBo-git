dwz is a dwarf compressor

DWARF optimization and duplicate removal tool

dwz is a program that attempts to optimize DWARF debugging
information contained in ELF shared libraries and ELF executables for
size, by replacing DWARF information representation with equivalent
smaller representation where possible and by reducing the amount of
duplication using techniques from DWARF standard appendix E -
creating DW_TAG_partial_unit compilation units (CUs) for duplicated
information and using DW_TAG_imported_unit to import it into each CU
that needs it.

sourcecode licence is GPL2. see COPYING and COPYING.RUNTIME for more
