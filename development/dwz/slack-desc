# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dwz:
dwz: DWARF optimization and duplicate removal tool
dwz: dwz is a program that attempts to optimize DWARF debugging
dwz: information contained in ELF shared libraries and ELF executables for
dwz: size, by replacing DWARF information representation with equivalent
dwz: smaller representation where possible and by reducing the amount of
dwz: duplication using techniques from DWARF standard appendix E -
dwz: creating DW_TAG_partial_unit compilation units (CUs) for duplicated
dwz: information and using DW_TAG_imported_unit to import it into each CU
dwz: that needs it. see https://sourceware.org/git/?p=dwz.git;a=summary
