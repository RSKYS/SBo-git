# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ebe: Ebe is an integrated development environment developed primarily
ebe: for teaching assembly language. It also allows development in C,
ebe: C++ and Fortran. The primary goal is to make development as simple
ebe: as possible for beginners. To that end a program can consist of a
ebe: single source code file and the Run button builds the program and
ebe: runs it using gdb internally as a debugger.
