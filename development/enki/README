Enki is a text editor for programmers. It is:

    User friendly. Intuitive interface. Works out of the box. You don't
    have to read a lot of docs.

    Hacker friendly. Work as quickly as possible. You don't need your
    mouse for coding.

    Lighweight. Some IDEs show splashscreen. Enki will never do it. It
    just starts quickly.

    Advanced. You invent software. An editor helps you to do a routine
    job.

    Extensible. Operating systems are designed for running
    applications. Enki is designed for running plugins.

    Cross platform. Use your habitual editor on any OS. Currently has
    beeen tested on Linux, MacOS X, Windows.

    High quality. No long list of fancy features. But, what is done,
    is done well.
