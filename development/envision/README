envision (graphics editing tool for Atari 8-bit systems)

envision is a graphics editing program similar to the old Atari
program Envision. It is a full-featured character editor and
map-maker. It supports both native files and .XFD disk images. It is
mouse based, and includes all the standard editing methods (flips,
fills, rotates, invert, etc).

The package includes the envision author's example disk image as
/usr/doc/envision-*/example.xfd (see also example.txt).
