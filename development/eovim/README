Eovim is a client for Neovim written using the Enlightenment Foundation
Library.

Eovim is written in plain C, with the amazing EFL, adding value to the
text-only neovim with a minimal runtime overhead. If you don't like
the externalized UI, it can be turned off, or changed via themes. Eovim
also provides its own plugin system, so the UI can be modified directly
from neovim.
