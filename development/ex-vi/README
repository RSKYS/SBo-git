ex-vi (traditional vi)

Bill Joy's original vi for UNIX.

This port of vi has generally preserved the original style, terminal
control, and feature set. It adds support for international character
sets, including multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, and some minor
enhancements that were not present in BSD vi 3.7, but had been included
in later vi versions for System V or in POSIX.2.

The "Introduction to Display Editing with Vi" mentioned in the man page
can be found at: http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/viin/paper.html

See README_Slackware.txt for Slack-specific details about this build.
