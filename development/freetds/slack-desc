# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

freetds:
freetds: FreeTDS is a free implementation of Sybase's db-lib, ct-lib, and
freetds: ODBC libraries. FreeTDS builds and runs on every flavor of unix-like
freetds: systems we've heard of, as well as Win32 (with or without Cygwin),
freetds: VMS, and Mac OS X. Failure to build on your system is probably
freetds: considered a bug. It has C language bindings, and works also with
freetds: Perl and PHP, among others.
