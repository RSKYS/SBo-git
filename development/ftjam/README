ftjam is make like program construction tool

This is "FT-Jam", a simple derivative of the Jam build tool, based on
and 100% compatible with Jam 2.5. 

Jam recursively builds target files from source files, using
dependency information and updating actions expressed in the Jambase
file, which is written in jam's own interpreted language.  The default
Jambase is compiled into jam and provides a boilerplate for common
use, relying on a user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual
targets and sources.
