ftnchek (a static analyzer for Fortran 77 programs)

ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is designed to detect certain
errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not.

ftnchek is not primarily intended to detect syntax errors. Its purpose
is to assist the user in finding semantic errors. Semantic errors are
legal in the Fortran language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect
operation.
