G3log is an asynchronous, "crash safe", logger that is easy to use with
default logging sinks or you can add your own. G3log is made with plain
C++11 with no external libraries (except gtest used for unit tests).
G3log is made to be cross-platform, currently running on OSX, Windows
and several Linux distros. See Readme below for details of usage.

What G3Log is:
- G3log is the acting name for the third version of g2log and it stands
  for g3log with dynamic sinks
- G3log is an asynchronous, "crash-safe" logger.
- You can choose to use the default log receiver which saves all LOG
  calls to file, or you can choose to use your own custom made log
  receiver(s), or both, or as many sinks as you need.
