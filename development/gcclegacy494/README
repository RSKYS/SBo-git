The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++,
Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, as well as libraries for these
languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler
for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100%
free software, free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.

This script only compiles the GNU C, and C++ front ends. This script
was written with the intention to compile a better PaleMoon.
