Geany is a text editor using the GTK2 toolkit with basic features of an
integrated development environment. It was developed to provide a
small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other
packages. It supports many filetypes and has some nice features. 

If you need the GTK Symbol completion tags (removed in Geany 0.16), get 
them (and other tag-files) from: http://download.geany.org/contrib/tags/

the easiest way to download them all is:

    lftp -c "open http://download.geany.org/contrib/; mirror tags"

The first option is to put them in $CWD at the time you build the 
package. Then tell the SlackBuild to include support for tags:

    TAGS=yes ./geany.SlackBuild

The second option is to download them and and place them in the
~/.config/geany/tags/ directory.  You will then need to restart 
Geany for this to take effect.
