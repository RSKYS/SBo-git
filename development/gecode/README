Gecode is a toolkit for developing constraint-based systems and
applications. Gecode provides a constraint solver with 
state-of-the-art performance while being modular and extensible.

The script supports two switches:

DODOCS = yes (default: no) to build the html docs (123 Mb)
DOEXAMPLES = yes (default: no) to build the examples

Note: the second option is disabled explicitly in the build
because installs example binaries in /usr/bin that may conflict
with other packages. If you decide to enable it, it's up to you
to check the contents of the resulting package for possibly
overlaps with your installation.
