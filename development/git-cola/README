git-cola is a sleek and powerful graphical user interface for Git.
git-cola is free software and written in Python (v2 + v3).

git-cola uses QtPy (included), so you can choose between PyQt4, PyQt5,
and PySide by setting the QT_API environment variable to pyqt4, pyqt5 or
pyside as desired.

pyside is an optional (untested by me) dependency.
send2trash is an optional (untested by me) dependency.
