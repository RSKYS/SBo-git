# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

git-crypt: git-crypt (transparent file encryption in git)
git-crypt:
git-crypt: git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a
git-crypt: a git repository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted
git-crypt: when committed, and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you
git-crypt: freely share a repository containing a mix of public and private
git-crypt: content. git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the
git-crypt: secret key can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted
git-crypt: files. This lets you store your secret material (such as keys or
git-crypt: passwords) in the same repository as your code, without requiring you
git-crypt: to lock down your entire repository
