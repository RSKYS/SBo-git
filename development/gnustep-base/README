GNUstep is a free, object-oriented, cross-platform development
environment that strives for simplicity and elegance.  GNUstep is based
on and completely compatible with the OpenStep specification developed
by NeXT (now Apple Computer Inc.) as well as implementing the
extensions added by Apple in the form of Cocoa.

This package contains GNUstep-base component of the core libraries
needed to write non-graphic tools in Objective-C.  It includes all of
the classes necessary for writing an incredible array of tools, from
wrappers for system tools to tools for communicating with web and other
types of servers.
