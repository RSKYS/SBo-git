# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gob2:
gob2: GOB (GOB2 anyway) is a preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C
gob2: code so that generated files are not edited. Syntax is inspired by
gob2: Java and Yacc or Lex. The implementation is intentionally kept simple,
gob2: and no C actual code parsing is done.
