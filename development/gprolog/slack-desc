# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gprolog: gprolog (produces native binaries from Prolog+constraint programs)
gprolog:
gprolog: GNU Prolog accepts Prolog+constraint programs and produces native
gprolog: binaries (like gcc does from a C source). The obtained executable
gprolog: is then stand-alone. The size of this executable can be quite small
gprolog: since GNU Prolog can avoid to link the code of most unused built-in
gprolog: predicates. Beside the native-code compilation, GNU Prolog offers
gprolog: a classical interactive interpreter (top-level) with a debugger.
gprolog: The Prolog part conforms to the ISO standard for Prolog with many
gprolog: extensions very useful in practice (global variables, OS interface,
gprolog: sockets,...).
