Halibut is a documentation production system, with elements similar to
TeX, debiandoc-sgml, TeXinfo, and others.  It is primarily targeted at
people producing software manuals.

Supported output formats are:
- Plain ASCII text
- HTML
- PDF
- PostScript
- Unix man pages
- Unix info, generated directly as .info files rather than .texi sources
- Windows HTML Help (.CHM files), generated directly without needing a
  separate help compiler.
- Windows WinHelp (old-style .HLP files), also generated directly.
