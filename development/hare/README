Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple,
stable, and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory
management, and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing
operating systems, system tools, compilers, networking software,
and other low-level, high performance tasks. 

Hare uses and depends on the QBE compiler backend.

Building hare (this "build driver") depends on:

    * scdoc - the man page generator
    * harec - the hare boostrap compiler
