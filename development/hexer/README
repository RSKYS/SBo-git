hexer (hex editor with vi-like UI)

Hexer is a multi-buffer editor for binary files for Unix-like systems
that displays its buffer(s) as a hex dump. The user interface is kept
similar to vi/ex.

If you don't like the default color scheme, copy one of the
/usr/doc/$VERSION/rc/hexerrc.* files to ~/.hexerrc.

The package also includes myc, a simple textmode calculator that's
useful for hex <=> decimal conversions and bitwise operations.
