hexinator (proprietary graphical hex editor with many features)

This is the free/demo version of hexinator from https://hexinator.com/.

hexinator is a powerful hex editor and reverse-engineering tool with
many advanced features. It's commercial, closed source software. The
demo version will function as the full version for a 14-day evaluation
period, with an option to extend it for another 14 days. After that,
only the basic hex editing functions will work. To purchase the full
version, see the web site.

Be aware that hexinator 'phones home' to www.synalysis.net. It uses an
encrypted connection, so it's uncertain exactly what data it's sending
to the server. If this seems like a major security/privacy concern to
you, you should not install this software.

Notes for 32-bit users:

1. Starting with 1.11, upstream has dropped 32-bit support. On 32-bit
   systems, this script will build a package of hexinator 1.10. If
   necessary, you can build older versions (1.08 and 1.09) by setting
   VERSION in the environment, but you won't be able to build anything
   newer than 1.10.

2. Automated tools such as sbopkg and sbotools may get confused by the
   fact that the .info file says VERSION=1.12, but the package version
   will be 1.10. One result is that sbopkg will probably keep saying
   there's an upgrade available. If this is a problem for you, simply
   blacklist hexinator in sbopkg's config.

3. The SlackBuild author has not tested the 32-bit version of hexinator,
   other than to verify that it creates a valid Slackware package. If it
   doesn't work correctly, please contact the maintainer using the email
   address in the hexinator.info file.
