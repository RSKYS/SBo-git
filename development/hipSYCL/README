  hipSYCL is a modern SYCL implementation targeting CPUs and GPUs,
with a focus on leveraging existing toolchains such as CUDA or HIP.
  hipSYCL supports compiling source files into a single binary that
can run on all these backends when building against appropriate
clang distributions.

  For enable optional backends set one of the following variables:
  - CUDA=yes, requires CUDA setup
  - ROCM=yes, requires ROCM setup
