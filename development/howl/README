Howl is a general purpose editor that aims to be both lightweight and
fully customizable. It's built on top of the very fast LuaJIT runtime,
and can be extended in either Lua or Moonscript. It has a minimalistic
UI driven mainly by the keyboard.
See its website for documentation and usage instructions.
