icdiff (improved color diff)

Show differences between files in a colorful two column view. Can be
used with as a "git diff" replacement, via "git-icdiff" command.

Note: It's highly recommended to use wide terminals with icdiff, for
instance 160 columns or more.

icdiff is similar in concept to colordiff, but it uses a two column
"side by side" format.
