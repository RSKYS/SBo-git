inform (interactive fiction compiler)

Inform 6 is version 6 of Inform, an interactive fiction programming
language created by Graham Nelson. Inform 6 made its debut on
April 30th, 1996, and it continues to be one of the most popular
IF development systems even after the introduction of Inform 7 in
2006. Inform 6, like all other versions of Inform, compiles to code
not only for the Z-machine, the same virtual machine used by Infocom,
but also for the more powerful and flexible virtual machine called
Glulx.

This is a command-line compiler for the Inform 6 language. For a
graphical Inform 7 compiler, see gnome-inform7. Inform 6 and 7 are
completely different languages, so it's not redundant to install both.

To get started writing interactive fiction with Inform, all the
documentation you need is installed in /usr/doc/inform-$VERSION:

inform_beginners_guide.pdf - aka IBG. Read this first.
manual/index.html - Inform Designer's Manual, aka DM4.
tutor/*.inf - Tutorials in Inform source code format.
demos/*.inf - Source to sample games.

Related packages: you'll want a Z-Code interpreter to try out your
creations. Install one of: fizmo, frotz, zoom.
