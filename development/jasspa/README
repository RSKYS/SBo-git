jasspa (enhanced microemacs text editor)

Jasspa's MicroEmacs is an Emacs editor biased towards UNIX users,
working across platforms by providing a consistent interface under
UNIX, Microsoft Windows 3.1/'95/'98/NT/2K/XP and DOS operating systems.
It features syntax highlighling, folding, multiple undo/redo, macro
languge, organizer, mailer, calendar, multiple frames and windows, and
much more. See its internal help for full list of features.

Jasspa is a descendant of the original microemacs, with a lot of
additions.

About the slackbuild script:
- The official way to build jasspa is to use the script named 'build'
  from the source distribution which autodetects a few things, so I use
  this script, but if I use this script I have to patch linux2.gmk
  and linux26.gmk.

- There is a special version called nanoemacs (ne) which is a small
  macro-less minimal version, only useful for extremly minimal
  installations, so I do not provide a build variant for it, because I
  think it is not so useful.

- Note, that while the package contains an updated macros collection
  from 2009.10.17, the version is 091011. This is intentional, the
  macros collection contains some minor fixes, but according to
  http://www.jasspa.com/downsrc.html: "The official baseline for 2009
  is 2009.10.11 ...", so the VERSION is 091011.
