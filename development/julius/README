"Julius" is a high-performance, two-pass large vocabulary continuous
speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder software for speech-related
researchers and developers. Based on word N-gram and context-dependent
HMM, it can perform almost real-time decoding on most current
PCs in 60k word dictation task.  Major search techniques are fully
incorporated such as tree lexicon, N-gram factoring, cross-word context
dependency handling, enveloped beam search, Gaussian pruning, Gaussian
selection, etc. Besides search efficiency, it is also modularized
carefully to be independent from model structures, and various HMM
types are supported such as shared-state triphones and tied-mixture
models, with any number of mixtures, states, or phones.  Standard
formats are adopted to cope with other free modeling toolkit such as
HTK, CMU-Cam SLM toolkit, etc.
