Kcov is a code coverage tester for compiled programs, Python scripts
and shell scripts. It allows collecting code coverage information from
executables without special command-line arguments, and continuously
produces output from long-running applications.

Using kcov is as simple as
  $ kcov /path/to/outdir executable [args for the executable]
