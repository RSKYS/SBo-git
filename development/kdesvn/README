kdesvn is a kde client for subversion. It uses native KDE API instead of
an extra lib like GAMBAS, and it is using the native subversion
development API instead of parsing the output of the commandline tool
like most other clients do.

It tries to setup a look and feel like the standard filemanager of
KDE and is integrated into it via KPart.
