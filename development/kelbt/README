kelbt (Backtracking LR Parsing)

Kelbt generates backtracking LALR(1) parsers. Where traditional
LALR(1) parser generators require static resolution of shift/reduce
conflicts, Kelbt generates parsers that handle conflicts by
backtracking at runtime. Kelbt is able to generate a parser for any
context-free grammar that is free of hidden left recursion.
