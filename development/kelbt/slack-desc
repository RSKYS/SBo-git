# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kelbt: kelbt (Backtracking LR Parsing)
kelbt:
kelbt: Kelbt generates backtracking LALR(1) parsers. Where traditional
kelbt: LALR(1) parser generators require static resolution of shift/reduce
kelbt: conflicts, Kelbt generates parsers that handle conflicts by
kelbt: backtracking at runtime. Kelbt is able to generate a parser for any
kelbt: context-free grammar that is free of hidden left recursion.
