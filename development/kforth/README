kForth is an implementation of the Forth programming language and 
environment. The user may write Forth programs with an editor,
load these program files from kForth, and run them. kForth, like
other implementations of Forth, provides an interactive environment,
allowing the user to examine or define variables and execute or
define individual words.

kForth is designed to be installed on a 32-bit linux operating system.
It will not install on 64-bit Slackware unless multilib support is
installed.
