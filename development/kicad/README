The KiCad project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source EDA Suite, capable of schematic and printed
circuit board design.  The suite consists of a project manager,
schematic editor, netlist converter, pcb designer and a gerber viewer.

There are separate SlackBuilds for the libraries and additional
documentation: kicad-library and kicad-doc.
