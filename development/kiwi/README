Kiwi is a framework and a set of enhanced PyGTK widgets designed to
make building programs with graphical interfaces both easy to write
and easy to maintain. Kiwi is pure Python and released under the LGPL.

Fully object-oriented, and roughly Smalltalk's MVC, Kiwi provides a
simple, practical way to build forms, windows and widgets that
transparently access and display your object data.  Kiwi is inspired
by Allen Holub's Visual Proxy.

NOTE: Additional functionality is provided if zope.interface and/or
SQLObject are installed.
