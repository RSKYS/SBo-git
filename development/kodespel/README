kodespel (spell-checker for source code)

kodespel is a spellchecker for source code. kodespel's nifty trick
is that it knows how to split common programming identifiers like
'getAllStuff' or 'DoThingsNow' or 'num_objects' or 'HTTPResponse' into
words, feed those to ispell, and interpret ispell's output.
