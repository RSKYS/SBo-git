The LDC project aims to provide a portable D programming language
compiler with modern optimization and code generation capabilities.
The compiler uses the official DMD frontend to support the latest D2
version and relies on the LLVM Core libraries for code generation.
LDC is fully Open Source; the parts of the code not taken/adapted from
other projects are BSD-licensed.
