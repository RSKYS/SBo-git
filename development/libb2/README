C library providing BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, BLAKE2bp, and BLAKE2sp.

The cryptographic hash function BLAKE2 is an improved version of the
SHA-3 finalist BLAKE. Like SHA-3, BLAKE2 offers the highest security,
yet is fast as MD5 on 64-bit platforms and requires at least 33% less
RAM than SHA-2 or SHA-3 on low-end systems.
