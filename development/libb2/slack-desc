# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libb2: libb2 (C library providing BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, BLAKE2bp, and BLAKE2sp)
libb2:
libb2: Libb2 is the C library of the cryptographic hash function BLAKE2, an
libb2: improved version of of the SHA-3 finalist BLAKE. Like SHA-3, BLAKE2
libb2: offers the highest security, yet is fast as MD5 on 64-bit platforms
libb2: and requires less RAM than SHA-2 or SHA-3 on low-end systems.
libb2:
libb2: The core algorithm of BLAKE2 is derived from ChaCha, a stream cipher
libb2: designed by Daniel J. Bernstein that has been proposed as a standard
libb2: cipher for TLS.
