Liberica JDK is a distribution of the Java Development Kit (JDK)
developed by BellSoft. It is a free and open source implementation of
the Java platform, and it provides compatibility with the Java SE
standard while also offering additional features and optimizations. All
Liberica JDK builds pass the Technology Compatibility Kit verification
before release.

Liberica JDK supports many Java versions, including both the latest and
legacy versions. It supports x86 64/32 bit, ARM, and other
architectures.

There are 3 Liberica JDK distribution flavors:
* Standard version is best suited for server and desktop deployments
  that do not require any additional components;
* Full version of Liberica includes LibericaFX, which is based on
  OpenJFX and Minimal VM, where suitable;
* Lite version of Liberica works best for cloud deployments and is
  optimized for size;
as well as JRE and JDK builds.

This SlackBuild packages the binary Liberica JDK distribution. The .info
file refers to the latest LTS version of the Standard Liberica JDK, but
the script works with any version and flavor of the Liberica JDK/JRE.
