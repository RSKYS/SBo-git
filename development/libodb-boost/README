ODB is an open-source, cross-platform, and cross-database object-
relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It allows you to persist 
C++ objects to a relational database without having to deal with 
tables, columns, or SQL and without manually writing any mapping 
code. 

ODB supports MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and 
Microsoft SQL Server relational databases as well as C++98/03 and 
C++11 language standards. It also comes with optional profiles 
for Boost and Qt which allow you to seamlessly use value types, 
containers, and smart pointers from these libraries in your 
persistent C++ classes.

The ODB system consists of several packages. The essential packages 
are the ODB compiler (odb), the common runtime library (libodb), 
and the database-specific runtime library (libodb-<database>). 
For example, if you are planning to use MySQL, then the set of 
packages that you will need would be: odb, libodb, and libodb-mysql.
