Like, Python was created by Jonathan Howard in February 
2010 while drinking and reviewing code for an upcoming 
project with a coworker. At a certain point, higher-level 
explanations devolved into just flat-out reading Python 
code like they were actually speaking the language normally
- complete with like's, um's, whatever's, etc - making it 
completely impractical^Wawesome for work. It was then that 
Jonathan realized he should perhaps stop for the night. 
And START creating Like, Python.
