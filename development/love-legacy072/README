LOVE is a framework for developing 2D games in Lua.

love-legacy072 is an older (0.7.2) version, for games written using the
0.7 API. It should not be used for developing new code (use the regular
love package for that instead).

Normally, games written with LOVE are started with "love gamename.love".
For games that need 0.7.2, start them with "love-0.7.2 gamename.love"
instead.
