MCU 8051 IDE is an integrated development environment for
microcontrollers based on 8051.

Supported programming languages are C and assembly. It has its own
assembler and support for 2 external assemblers. For C language it uses
SDCC compiler.

This program is intended for Linux systems, other POSIX systems and
Microsoft(r) Windows(r) system.

This IDE contains simulator, source code editor, assembler, HW
programmer and much other tools. Simulator supports over 79 MCU
primarily from Atmel.

HW programmer supports 8 ISP programmable MCUs from Atmel (AT89Sxx,
AT89LSxx). There is also support for simple hardware simulation (like
LEDs, keys, etc).
