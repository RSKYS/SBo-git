Meld is a visual diff and merge tool.

You can compare two or three files and edit them in place (diffs
update dynamically). You can compare two or three folders and launch
file comparisons. You can browse and view a working copy from popular
version control systems such such as CVS, Subversion, Bazaar-ng and
Mercurial.

This one uses GTK+3 instead of GTK+2.

NOTE: This package conflicts with the previous version of meld.
Only install one of them, but NOT BOTH.
