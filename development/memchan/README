Memchan provides several new channel types for in-memory channels
and the appropriate commands for their creation. They are useful to
transfer large amounts of data between procedures or interpreters, and
additionally provide an easy interface to on-the-fly generation of code
or data too. No need to [set] or [append] to a string, just do a simple
[puts].
