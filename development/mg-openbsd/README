mg-openbsd (Portable version of the OpenBSD mg editor).

mg is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people who
can't (or don't want to) run emacs for one reason or another, or are not
familiar with the vi editor.

It is compatible with emacs because there shouldn't be any reason to
learn more editor types than emacs or vi.
