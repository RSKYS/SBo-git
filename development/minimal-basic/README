minimal-basic (compiler for ECMA-55 Minimal BASIC)

This software is a compiler for 'Minimal BASIC' as specified by the
ECMA-55 standard. The target is AMD64/EM64T/x86-64 machines running a
modern Linux distribution.

The compiler is called ecma55, but it's normally called via wrapper
scripts called BASICC, BASICCS, or BASICCW. Man pages are included for
all of these commands.

There's sample code in /usr/share/minimal-basic, and quite a bit
of documentation in /usr/doc/minimal-basic-$VERSION, including a
copy of the language standard (ECMA-55.TXT) and a complete book
(Learn_BASIC.pdf).

Note: This will only compile on x86_64 because it's partly written in
x86_64 assembly. No way will it ever compile for 32-bit x86 (or any
ARM). Even if it would build on 32-bit, it would be a cross compiler:
it only generates x86_64 code, which would not be very useful on an
x86 system.
