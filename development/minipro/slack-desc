# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

minipro: This program exists because the manufacturer of the MiniPRO TL866xx
minipro: series of chip programmers does not provide a program for use on
minipro: Linux or other flavors of Unix. We who keep this project going
minipro: prefer a simple, free, and open-source program that presents a
minipro: command-line interface that allows for a GUI front-end if desired.
