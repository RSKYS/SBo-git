mkchroot (create chroot-able directory tree)

mkchroot creates a chroot-able directory tree using hard links where
possible. The mkchroot package consists of 2 utilities: mkchroot and
addchroot. mkchroot creates a minimal initial tree. addchroot
then incorporates (installed) Slackware packages into that tree.

HOW IT WORKS: addchroot uses the FILE LIST portion of the package file
in /var/log/packages to install a package's directories and files.
To complete the process, addchroot chroots the install script from
/var/log/scripts.

addchroot knows about some "special" packages for which it does not
run the normal install script, e.g. bash and glibc. If you find a new
"special" package, please tell the author.
