MLton is a whole-program, ahead-of-time Standard ML compiler featuring
excellent application performance and partial Successor ML support.

This build script uses a pre-built version of MLton from mlton.org to
compile the MLton package. This pre-built compiler is only available
for x86_64. Builds usually require 2GB of memory.

For extra documentation in /usr/share/doc, invoke with a "docs" flag:
