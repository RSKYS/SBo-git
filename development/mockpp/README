Mockpp is a platform independent generic unit testing framework for
C++. It's goal is to facilitate developing unit tests in the spirit of
Mock Objects for Java, EasyMock and jMock.

Mock objects allow you to set up predictible behaviour to help you
test your production code by emulating some functionality your code
depends on. This might for example be a huge database which is too
difficult and time consuming to maintain just for testing purposes.
