mold - a faster drop-in replacement for existing Unix linkers

It is several times faster than the LLVM lld linker, the
second-fastest open-source linker which was created by the same author
a few years ago. mold is designed to increase developer productivity by
reducing build time, especially in rapid debug-edit-rebuild cycles.
