A Native compiler for Visual Basic.NET support in Mono.

Having a native compiler for Visual Basic not only allows developers
that wish to completely develop a Mono supported platform, but also
allows applications that depend on the CodeDOM (ASP.NET for example)
to be developed using Visual Basic. Something that before the
availability of the compiler was not possible.
