Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to
easily create cross platform applications.  It is an open source
implementation of Microsoft's .Net Framework based on the ECMA
standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime.  We feel that by
embracing a successful, standardized software platform, we can lower
the barriers to producing great applications for Linux.

Note:
 - Mono build relies on a working Mono C# compiler to compile itself
   (also known as bootstrapping). However, without Mono installed, the
   build process uses the 'monolite' distribution, which contains just
   enough to run the 'mcs' compiler.
   This is considered a "slightly more risky approach" to build Mono.
   So, besides Mono sources, this SlackBuild uses a full featured
   and precompiled Mono Compiler to bootstrap.

 - After installing, it's recommended to run this command
   /usr/bin/cert-sync /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
