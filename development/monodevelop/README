MonoDevelop is a cross-platform IDE primarily designed for C# and
other .NET languages. MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write
desktop and ASP.NET Web applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX.
MonoDevelop makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications
created with Visual Studio to Linux and Mac OSX maintaining a single
code base for all platforms.

Note: oxygen-gtk causes MonoDevelop source editor to be blank.
A workaround is to use a different GTK2 Theme; Adwaita,
Oxygen-Molecule, QtCurve, etc.
Another workaround is to set OXYGEN_DISABLE_INNER_SHADOWS_HACK=1
environment variable.

This script will build with GIT support alongside with default SVN.
