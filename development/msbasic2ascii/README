msbasic2ascii (detokenizers for MS BASIC variants)

This package contains detokenizers for 12 different flavors of
Microsoft BASIC. They convert the binary SAVE format to human
readable BASIC source. Supported BASICs include TSR-80 Model I Level
II (trs80ascii) and Model 4 (trsm4ascii), MSX (msxascii), GW-BASIC
(gwascii), MS-BASIC for CP/M (cpmascii), Tandy CoCo (cocoascii),
Dragon 32/64 (drascii).

Also, experimental unsupported detokenizers are included for
OSI 8K BASIC (osiascii), Exidy Sorceror (sorcascii), Nascom
BASIC (nscmascii), Crytal BASIC (xtalascii), and Compucolor
(compucolorascii). Some of these are known to be incomplete, and some
just need testing against real-world code.
