mspgcc-legacy (msp430 C cross-compiler)

A msp430 C cross-compiler from the old Sourceforge mspgcc project.

The Sourceforge mspgcc project is obsolete. However, this is a stable
version and is useful for many purposes (e.g. compiling Contiki and
TinyOS)

Please note that this script uses gcc version 4.6.4 instead of 4.6.3
(suggested by mspgcc website), as the latter causes many compiling
errors.
