Pinba (PHP Is Not A Bottleneck Anymore) is a statistics server
using MySQL as an interface. It accumulates and processes data
sent over UDP by multiple PHP processes and displays statistics
in a nice human-readable form of simple "reports", also providing
read-only interface to the raw data in order to make possible
generation of more sophisticated reports.

Upstream recommends using a different memory allocator than the
default one to cut down on memory usage. You can specify which
one you want to use by passing either MALLOC="hoard" or
MALLOC="jemalloc" to the script. This depends on hoard or jemalloc
respectively. By default the default memory allocator is used.

The pinba storage plugin works with both mysql and mariadb.
