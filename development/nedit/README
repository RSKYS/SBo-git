NEdit (text editor with GUI)

NEdit is a powerful plain text editor with a Motif GUI. It features
advanced macros, line numbering and syntax highlighting. Despite
being feature rich it is easy to use, even for casual users.

The Slackbuild renames 'nc' (the client version of nedit) to 'ncl',
to avoid a clash with netcat.
