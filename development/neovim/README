Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:

* Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions
* Split the work between multiple developers
* Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any
  modifications to the core source
* Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture

note on building:
be sure to have lua (5.1) installed so that the lua-libraries neovim
depends on are packaged for 5.1 (e.g. lpeg). the lua used in neovim is
shipped with it, so lua isn't a direct dependency for neovim and not
listed in REQUIRES.
