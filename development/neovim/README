Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:

* Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions
* Split the work between multiple developers
* Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any
  modifications to the core source
* Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture
