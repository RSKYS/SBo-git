newLISP is a Lisp-like, general-purpose scripting language. It is
especially well-suited for applications in AI, simulation, natural
language processing, big data, machine learning and statistics.
Because of its small resource requirements, newLISP is excellent for
embedded systems applications. Most of the functions you will ever
need are already built in. This includes networking functions,
support for distributed and multicore processing, and Bayesian
statistics.
