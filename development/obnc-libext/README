obnc-libext (Extended Library for OBNC)

This package complements the basic libraries bundled with OBNC (the
Oberon compiler obnc) with modules for accessing command line arguments
and evironment variables, printing to the standard error stream and
converting numbers to strings and viceversa.

Be sure to update the compiler package (obnc) before updating this
library package, as it usually needs the latest compiler features in
order to compile.
