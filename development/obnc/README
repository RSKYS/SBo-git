OBNC (Oberon-07 Compiler)

OBNC is a compiler for Niklaus Wirth's programming language Oberon. It
implements the latest version of the language from 2016. OBNC
translates source code written in Oberon to the C programming language,
and the translated code is then compiled and linked with the C compiler
of the host operating system. The build command obnc performs all these
tasks and keeps track of which files need to be recompiled.

It comes with a small basic library of seven modules defined in The
Oakwood Guidelines for Oberon-2 Compiler Developers, to access files,
output etc.
