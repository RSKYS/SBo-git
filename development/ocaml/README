Caml is a general-purpose programming language, designed with
program safety and reliability in mind. It is very expressive,
yet easy to learn and use.  Caml supports functional, imperative,
and object-oriented programming styles.  The Objective Caml system is
the main implementation of the Caml language.  It features a powerful
module system and a full-fledged object-oriented layer.  It comes with
a native-code compiler that supports numerous architectures, for high
performance; a bytecode compiler, for increased portability; and an
interactive loop, for experimentation and rapid development.
