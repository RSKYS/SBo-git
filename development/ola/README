The Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) provides a plugin framework for
distributing DMX512 control signals on Mac and Linux. It provides C++
and Python libraries which abstract away the underlying DMX over IP
protocol or DMX interface. See http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA for
more information.

The build script can optionally disable python bindings and/or enable
the embedded http server.  WITH_PYTHON=no will disable the python
bindings, and WITH_HTTP=yes will enable the embedded http server (in
which case libmicrohttp also be required).
