  oneTBB is a flexible C++ library that simplifies the work of adding
parallelism to complex applications, even if you are not a threading
expert.

  The library lets you easily write parallel programs that take full
advantage of the multi-core performance. Such programs are portable,
composable and have a future-proof scalability. oneTBB provides you
with functions, interfaces, and classes to parallelize and scale the
code. All you have to do is to use the templates.

  For enabling Python build set the variable PYTHON=yes

  Optional: hwloc (auto-detect)
