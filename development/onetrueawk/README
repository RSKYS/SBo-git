onetrueawk (port of original UNIX awk)

This is the version of awk described in "The AWK Programming
Language", by Al Aho, Brian Kernighan, and Peter Weinberger
(Addison-Wesley, 1988, ISBN 0-201-07981-X). It is still maintained,
and has received many bug fixes since the book was released. The code
is released under a BSD-style license.

The executable and man page are installed as "otawk", to avoid
conflicting with Slackware's own gawk package. Also, otawk is
installed to /opt/onetrueawk/bin/awk, so you can use it as the default
awk by adjusting your user's $PATH (but it's not recommended to do
this system-wide).

If you want to run the test suite, export MAKETEST=yes in the
environment. The test results will be saved to:
/usr/doc/onetrueawk-$VERSION/maketest.log
