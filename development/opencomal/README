opencomal (interpreter for Comal programming language)

OpenComal is a portable and free implementation of the Comal programming
language written by Jos Visser. Currently supported platforms are Unix,
MsDos and Win32. Comal is a crossover between Basic and Pascal, with
the best features of both and none of the drawbacks of either.

opencomal development stopped in January 2002. By default, this script
builds the last stable release of opencomal. If you'd rather build
the last beta, see README.beta.
