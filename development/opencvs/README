OpenCVS is a FREE implementation of the Concurrent Versions System,
the most popular open source revision control software. It can be
used as both client and server for repositories and provides granular
access control over data stored in the repository. It aims to be as
compatible as possible with other CVS implementations, except when
particular features reduce the overall security of the system.

OpenCVS is developed under and for OpenBSD only. This is the portable
version which allows non-OpenBSD users to use OpenCVS instead of CVS.
