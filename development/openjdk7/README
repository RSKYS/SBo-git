OpenJDK 7 is an open source implementation of version 7 of the
Java Development Kit, Standard Edition.  It includes tools for
developing, testing, and running programs written in Java.

This build requires gcc5.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's/jre's
that you have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the
PATH, JAVA_HOME and MANPATH variables.

After installing the package you will need to logout/login to your
machine as it will add new files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

This script may take a couple of hours to complete and will require
about 11 GB of disk space for its temporary directory.  It defaults to
"/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./openjdk7.SlackBuild

The 'cacerts' binary is a TrustStore containing CA certificates which
are used by Java applications.  It is taken from the CentOS package
'ca-certificates-2015.2.4-65.0.1.el6_6.noarch.rpm'.

NOTES
1.  The apache-ant in SBo (1.10.x) is incompatible with openjdk7,
so the script now uses the previous version (1.9.x) to build.

2. Currently this will only build on 64-bit.  On 32-bit, it need to
link with the libstdc++ in gcc5 but tries to link with the default
/usr/lib/libstc++ and errors out with the message:

/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: \
  undefined reference to `__divmoddi4@GCC_7.0.0'

Any help with this issue would be GREATLY appreciated.
