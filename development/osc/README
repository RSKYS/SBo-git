osc is a subversion-like client to the the OpenSUSE Build Service. It
serves as client for the source code repository part of the build
service, and it can be used to edit metadata, query about build
results, and do virtually everything (and more) accessible from the web
interface.

On first run, osc will prompt you for your OpenSUSE Build Service
credentials, and store them plaintext in ~/.oscrc.  Guard the file and
filesystem appropriately.
