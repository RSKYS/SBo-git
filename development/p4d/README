This is the Perforce Helix server, a commercial version control system.

You only need this p4d package to host your own server, or to use
the DVCS features of Perforce. If you just need a Perforce client to
connect to a server someone else hosts, use the "p4" (command line) or
"p4v" (GUI) Slackbuild instead.
