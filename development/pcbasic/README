pcbasic (GW-BASIC interpreter)

pcbasic is a free, cross-platform emulator for the GW-BASIC family of
interpreters. It can run classic games and legacy BASIC applications
designed for MS-DOS systems, IBM PC, PCjr or Tandy 1000. It aims for
bug-for-bug compatibility with Microsoft GW-BASIC. It runs ASCII,
tokenised and protected BASIC programs and supports the Microsoft
Binary Format for full interchangeability of data files.

Full documentation and sample code are in "/usr/doc/pcbasic-$VERSION".
