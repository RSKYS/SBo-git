Pinba (PHP Is Not A Bottleneck Anymore) is a statistics server
using MySQL as an interface. It accumulates and processes data
sent over UDP by multiple PHP processes and displays statistics
in a nice human-readable form of simple "reports", also providing
read-only interface to the raw data in order to make possible
generation of more sophisticated reports.
