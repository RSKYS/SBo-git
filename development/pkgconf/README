pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker
flags for development frameworks. It is similar to pkg-config from
freedesktop.org.

libpkgconf is a library which provides access to most of pkgconf's
functionality, to allow other tooling such as compilers and IDEs to
discover and use frameworks configured by pkgconf.

NOTE: This package will conflict with pkg-config included in a full
Slackware install. You should remove pkg-config before installing
pkgconf. This can be reversed by removing pkgconf and reinstalling
pkg-config. A new user session will be needed for the environment
variables to be correct.

If you are using slackpkg add this line to your blacklist file found at
'/etc/slackpkg/blacklist'.

  pkg-config

To build debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./pkgconf.SlackBuild
