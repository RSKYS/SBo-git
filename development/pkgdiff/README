pkgdiff (visualize changes in tgz/rpm/deb/etc archives)

Package Changes Analyzer (pkgdiff) - a tool for visualizing changes in
Linux software packages (RPM, DEB, TAR.GZ, etc). The tool is intended
for Linux maintainers who are interested in ensuring compatibility
of old and new versions of packages. It's useful for both source and
binary packages.

The tool can compare directories as well (with the help of the -d
option).
