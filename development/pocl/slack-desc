# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pocl: pocl (Portable Computing Language, an OpenCL standard implementation)
pocl:
pocl: PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
pocl: OpenCL standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition
pocl: to being an easily portable multi-device (truely heterogeneous)
pocl: open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of this project is
pocl: improving interoperability of diversity of OpenCL-capable devices by
pocl: integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform. Also
pocl: one of the key goals longer term is to enhance performance
pocl: portability of OpenCL programs across device types utilizing runtime
pocl: and compiler techniques.
