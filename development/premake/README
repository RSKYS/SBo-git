premake (build configuration tool)

Describe your C, C++, or C# software project using a simple, easy to
read syntax and let Premake generate the project files. Premake allows
you to manage your project configuration in one place and still
support those pesky IDE-addicted Windows coders. It also provides a
complete Lua scripting environment, enabling the automation of
complex configuration tasks.
