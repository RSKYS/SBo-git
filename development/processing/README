Processing is a programming language, development environment, and
online community that since 2001 has promoted software literacy
within the visual arts. Initially created to serve as a software
sketchbook and to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a
visual context, Processing quickly developed into a tool for creating
finished professional work as well.

As of 3.5.4, processing no longer supports 32-bit.
