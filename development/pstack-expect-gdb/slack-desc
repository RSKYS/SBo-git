# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pstack-expect-gdb: pstack-expect-gdb (print stack traces of running processes)
pstack-expect-gdb:
pstack-expect-gdb: pstack uses expect to run gdb to attach to each process named on
pstack-expect-gdb: the command line, and output a backtrace for every thread in that
pstack-expect-gdb: process.  One may print threads with thread 1 either first or last.
pstack-expect-gdb: There are verbose modes for debugging, or just to see how it works.
