QBE is a compiler backend that aims to provide 70% of the performance of
industrial optimizing compilers in 10% of the code.

QBE fosters language innovation by offering a compact user-friendly and
performant backend. The size limit constrains QBE to focus on the
essential and prevents embarking on a never-ending path of diminishing
returns.
