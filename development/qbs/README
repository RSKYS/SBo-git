Qbs is a build automation tool designed to conveniently manage the build
process of software projects across multiple platforms. Qbs can be used
for any software project, regardless of programming language, toolkit or
libraries used.

NOTES:
1. Remove any previous Qbs installations before building this package.

2. Sometimes the old Qbs profiles do not work with updated version of
   Qbs. These files are located in ~/.config/QtProject/qbs directory.
   Deleting this directory and recreating the profiles is a possible
   workaround.
