  Qbsolv,a decomposing solver, finds a minimum value of a large
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem by splitting
it into pieces solved either via a D-Wave system or a classical tabu
solver. (Note that qbsolv by default uses its internal classical
solver. Access to a D-Wave system must be arranged separately.)
