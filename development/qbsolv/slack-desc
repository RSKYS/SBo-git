# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

qbsolv:   Qbsolv, a decomposing solver, finds a minimum value of a large
qbsolv: quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem by
qbsolv: splitting it into pieces solved either via a D-Wave system or a
qbsolv: classical tabu solver. (Note that qbsolv by default uses its
qbsolv: internal classical solver. Access to a D-Wave system must be
qbsolv: arranged separately.)
