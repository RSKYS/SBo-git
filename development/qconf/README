QConf allows you to have a nice configure script for your qmake-based
project.  It is intended for developers who don't need (or want) to use
the more complex GNU autotools.

Scripts generated by QConf are meant for unix.  This means it should
only be used with projects based on Qt/X11, Qt/Mac, or Qt/Embedded.
No effort has been made in supporting Qt/Windows based projects (yet).

NOTE: QConf is a Qt 4 program as of version 1.2.  However, it can still
  generate configure scripts for Qt 3 apps.  See below for information.
