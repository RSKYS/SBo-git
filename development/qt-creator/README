Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
tailored to the needs of Qt developers, but is also perfectly usable
for non-Qt C/C++ projects. Qt Creator focuses on providing features
that help new Qt users get up and running faster, and also boost the
productivity of experienced Qt developers.

Feature highlights include:
- advanced code editor,
- visual debugger,
- GUI designers.

NOTES:
1. This package conflicts with qt-creator2:
   install only one of the two.

2. This version of Qt Creator is advised for Qt5.

3. Before building/editing your application, you should configure
   the Qt Kits (Tools -> Options -> Build & Run -> Kits).

4. QmlDesigner will work properly only if you configure the Qt5 Kit
   properly and make it the Default Kit.

5. An old IDE configuration in user home directory
   (~/.config/QtProject*) can lead to strange behavior.

6. Some functionality of Qt Creator, like Clang Code Model or Clang
   Static Analyzer, depends on the qt-creator-llvm package. To enable
   these additional features, build and install qt-creator-llvm package
   and then build the Qt Creator package like that:

   $ USE_LLVM=yes ./qt-creator.SlackBuild

   Note: CODE_MODEL=yes option is synonym for USE_LLVM=yes and is kept
   for backward compatibility and will be removed for Slackware 15.0.
