Qt Creator 2 is a Cross-Platform Qt IDE.

The goal of Qt Creator is to provide a cross-platform, complete
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop Qt projects.

NOTE1: This package conflicts with qt-creator: install only one of
       the two.

NOTE2: QmlDesigner needs Qt Private Headers. If you intend to build the
       QmlDesigner you need to specify the Qt source location. Besides,
       it is required to apply all patches from Slackware tree and run
       configure. Note that the configure process takes some time to
       finish due to the qmake compile process.

Follow these steps to prepare source tree:
1 - Copy Qt SlackBuild directory from Slackware source tree to /tmp;
2 - Edit qt-nowebkit.SlackBuild and place an exit command AFTER the
    configure command;
3 - Execute qt.SlackBuild;
4 - move /tmp/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-x.x.x to /usr/src

QTSOURCEDIR is set to /usr/src/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-x.x.x
(Qt version from Slackware tree).
