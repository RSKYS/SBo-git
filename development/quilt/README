These scripts allow to manage a series of patches by keeping track
of the changes each patch makes.  Patches can be applied, un-applied,
refreshed, etc.

The key philosophical concept is that your primary output is patches
- not ".c" files, not ".h" files, but patches, so patches are the
first-class object here.

Quilt was originally based on Andrew Morton's patch scripts published
on the linux kernel mailing list a while ago, but were heavily modified
since then.
