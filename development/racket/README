Racket (formerly named PLT Scheme) is a general purpose, multi-paradigm
programming language in the Lisp/Scheme family. One of its design
goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and
implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as
scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and
research. (source: Wikipedia)

racket is the command line version, drracket is the GUI-version

This SlackBuild uses the src + built packages distribution. It builds
faster as it contains platform-independent bytecode. If you wish to
build from pure source code can be downloaded from the racket site:
