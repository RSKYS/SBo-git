radare2 (the reverse engineering framework)

This is the rewrite of radare (1.x branch) to provide a framework
with a set of libraries and programs to work with binary data.

Radare project started as a forensics tool, an scriptable
commandline hexadecimal editor able to open disk files, but later
support for analyzing binaries, disassembling code, debugging
programs, attaching to remote gdb servers, ...

radare2 is portable.
