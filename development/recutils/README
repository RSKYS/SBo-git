GNU Recutils is a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable,
plain text databases called recfiles. The data is stored as a sequence
of records, each record containing an arbitrary number of named fields.

mdbutils is an optional dependency (autodetected) required to build the
mdb2rec utility (will patch the source and run autoreconf).
If you already have the mdbutils package installed, but do not want the
mdb2rec utility, set the MDB2REC environment variable to "no" before
executing the script, e.g.
  MDB2REC="no" ./recutils.SlackBuild
