redo - a recursive, general-purpose build system

redo is a competitor to the long-lived, but sadly imperfect make
program.  Unlike other such competitors, redo captures the essential
simplicity and flexibility of make, while avoiding its flaws. It manages
to do this while being simultaneously simpler than make, more flexible
than make, and more powerful than make, without sacrificing performance
- a rare combination of features.
