Regexxer is a nifty search/replace tool for the desktop user.
It features recursive search through directory trees and Perl-style
regular expressions (using libpcre).

The primary audience of this tool are Linux/Unix users who are tired of
typing find/grep/sed/awk/perl command lines.

The user interface is similar to the project-wide search/replace
dialog in the Sniff+ IDE, but regexxer aims to surpass it.
