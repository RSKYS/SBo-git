rgbds (cross assembler targeting Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Color)

RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker
package for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of rgbasm
(assembler), rgblink (linker), rgbfix (checksum/header fixer), and
rgbgfx (PNG-to-Game Boy graphics converter).

This is a fork of the original RGBDS which aims to make the programs
more like other UNIX tools.
