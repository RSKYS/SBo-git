rizin (Free and Open Source Reverse Engineering Framework)

A free and open-source Reverse Engineering framework, providing a
complete binary analysis experience with features like Disassembler,
Hexadecimal editor, Emulation, Binary inspection, Debugger, and more.

Rizin takes a unique, Unix-friendly approach on reverse engineering. By
default, it can be used in a shell-like environment tailored
specifically to analyzing binaries directly from the command line
without unnecessary weight. However, if you do want more, it provides a
perfect basis for GUI and scripting.
