rmac (cross assembler for 6502 and 68000)

RMAC began its life as MADMAC. It was initially written at Atari
Corporation by programmers who needed a high performance assembler for
their work. Then, more than 20 years later, because there was still a
need for such an assembler and what was available wasn't up to
expectations, Subqmod and eventually Reboot continued work on the
freely released source, adding Jaguar extensions and fixing bugs. And
of course recently 6502 support was added back!

RMAC targets the Atari Jaguar, ST, and 800/XL/XE 8-bit systems. The
file "ATARI.S" mentioned in the documentation is installed to
"/usr/share/rmac/atari.s". To use it in a project, either copy it to
the project directory, or give -i/usr/share/rmac as an argument to rmac.
