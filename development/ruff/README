Ruff! (Runtime function formatter) is a documentation generation
system for programs written in the Tcl programming language. Ruff! is
included with Woof! but can be used independently of it. Ruff! uses
runtime introspection in conjunction with comment analysis to generate
reference manuals for Tcl programs.

In comparison with source code based documentation generators, Ruff!
produces documentation that not only requires less effort from
the programmer, but is also more complete, more accurate and more
maintainable.

Ruff! is covered by a liberal BSD open-source license that permits use
for any purpose.
