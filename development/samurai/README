samurai is a ninja-compatible build tool written in C99 with a focus
on simplicity, speed, and portability.

It is largely feature-complete and supports most of the same options
as ninja.

Many SlackBuild scripts allow setting the NINJA environment variable
to use samu instead of ninja.

  export NINJA='samu'
