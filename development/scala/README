Scala is a functional object-oriented programming language compiling to
JVM byte code.

This is a binary repackaging of the distribution from the Scala
home-page.  It sets SCALA_HOME=/usr/lib/scala, MANPATH to include
/usr/lib/scala/man, and PATH to include /usr/lib/scala/bin.

The installation is like Java Runtime/SDK, in that it places everything
by default in /usr/lib/scala - including manpages and documentation.

The lib directory is set dependent upon the package architecture:
/usr/lib on x86 and /usr/lib64 on x86_64.
