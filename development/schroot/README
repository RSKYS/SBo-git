 Schroot is an evolution of the Unix "chroot" command, with
enhancements that make it well suited for software development,
especially for testing build and install scripts such as Slackbuild
scripts where virtualization is not necessary.

 Schroot supports many types of chrooted environments, from simple
directories to filesystem images, and can automate steps such as
remounting /proc, /dev, and /tmp, setting up the chroots password
and group files, etc.

 To get started, see schroot.conf(5) and schroot-setup(5).

 This package will link against Linux-PAM if it is present.
