SDCC is a retargettable, optimizing Standard C (ANSI C89, ISO C99, ISO
C11) compiler suite that targets the Intel MCS51 based microprocessors
(8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.), Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390
variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 based (hc08, s08), Zilog
Z80 based MCUs (z80, z180, gbz80, Rabbit 2000/3000, Rabbit 3000A,
TLCS-90), Padauk (pdk14, pdk15) and STMicroelectronics STM8.  Work is
in progress on supporting the Padauk (pdk13), Microchip PIC16 and
PIC18 targets.  It can be retargeted for other microprocessors.

By default, this will build sdcc without pic support.  If you want
that, install gputils and run the script as follows:

ENABLE_PIC=y sh ./sdcc.SlackBuild
