# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sdcc: sdcc (Small Device C Compiler)
sdcc:
sdcc: SDCC is a retargettable, optimizing Standard C (ANSI C89, ISO C99, ISO
sdcc: C11) compiler suite that targets the Intel MCS51 based microprocessors
sdcc: (8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.), Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390
sdcc: variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 based (hc08, s08), Zilog
sdcc: Z80 based MCUs (z80, z180, gbz80, Rabbit 2000/3000, Rabbit 3000A,
sdcc: TLCS-90), Padauk (pdk14, pdk15) and STMicroelectronics STM8.  Work is
sdcc: in progress on supporting the Padauk (pdk13), Microchip PIC16 and
sdcc: PIC18 targets.  It can be retargeted for other microprocessors.
