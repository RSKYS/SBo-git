simavr is a new AVR simulator for linux, or any platform that uses
avr-gcc. It uses avr-gcc's own register definition to simplify creating
new targets for supported AVR devices. The core was made to be small and
compact, and hackable so allow quick prototyping of an AVR project. The
AVR core is now stable for use with parts with <= 128KB flash, and with
preliminary support for the bigger parts. The simulator loads ELF files
directly, and there is even a way to specify simulation parameters
directly in the emulated code using an .elf section. You can also
load multipart HEX files.
