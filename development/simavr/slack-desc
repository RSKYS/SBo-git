# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

simavr: simavr (A lean, mean and hackable AVR simulator)
simavr:
simavr: simavr uses avr-gcc's own register definition to simplify
simavr: creating new targets for supported AVR devices. The core
simavr: was made to be small and compact, and hackable so allow quick
simavr: prototyping of an AVR project. The AVR core is now stable for
simavr: use with parts with <= 128KB flash, and with preliminary support
simavr: for the bigger parts. The simulator loads ELF files directly,
simavr: and there is even a way to specify simulation parameters directly
simavr: in the emulated code using an .elf section. You can also
simavr: load multipart HEX files.
