# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

snappy: snappy (A fast compressor/decompressor)
snappy:
snappy: Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
snappy: maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
snappy: library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
snappy: compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib,
snappy: Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the
snappy: resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger.
