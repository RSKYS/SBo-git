Spin is a popular open-source software tool, used by thousands of
people worldwide, that can be used for the formal verification of
distributed software systems. In April 2002 the tool was awarded the
prestigious System Software Award for 2001 by the ACM.

By default the ispin GUI will not be installed. This may be overridden
by building with:

`GUI=yes ./spin.SlackBuild`
