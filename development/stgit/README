StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to
Quilt (i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT.
These operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are
stored as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT
patches into other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
