tcc (Tiny C Compiler)

Tiny C Compiler is a very fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers,
it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external assembler
or linker because TCC does that for you.

TCC supports ANSI C and most of ISO C99 and many GNUC extensions,
including inline assembly. tcc was written by Fabrice Bellard and is
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Currently, tcc development happens in the github repo at
https://github.com/TinyCC/tinycc

By default, both native and cross compilers for various systems (Win32,
Win64, ARM, OSX, etc) are built. If you want to skip the cross
compilers, pass CROSS=no to the script.
