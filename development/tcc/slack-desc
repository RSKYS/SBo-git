# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tcc:
tcc: Tiny C Compiler is a very fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers,
tcc: it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external
tcc: assembler or linker because TCC does that for you.
tcc: TCC supports ANSI C and most of ISO C99 and many GNUC extensions,
tcc: including inline assembly. tcc was written by Fabrice Bellard and is
