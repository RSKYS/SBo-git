Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool
created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision a
datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language
known as Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
