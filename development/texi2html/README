texi2html converts texinfo documents to HTML, Info, docbook, and XML.

Consider texi2html to be deprecated: according to its homepage,
"the route forward for authors is, in most cases, to alter manuals
and build processes as necessary to use the new features of the
makeinfo/texi2any implementation of GNU Texinfo.
