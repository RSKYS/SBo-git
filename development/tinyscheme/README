TinyScheme is a lightweight Scheme interpreter that implements as large
subset of R5RS as was possible without getting very large and complicated.
It's meant to be used as an embedded scripting interpreter for
other programs. As such, it does not offer IDEs or extensive toolkits
although it does sport a small top-level loop, included conditionally.
A lot of functionality in TinyScheme is included conditionally,
to allow developers freedom in balancing features and footprint.

The compiled binary is installed as "tinyscheme" instead of "scheme" in
order to avoid possible conflicts with other Scheme implementations that
might be installed in the user's system.
