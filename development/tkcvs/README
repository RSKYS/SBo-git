TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS and
Subversion configuration management systems. It displays the status of
the files in the current working directory, and provides buttons and
menus to execute configuration-management commands on the selected
files. Limited RCS functionality is also present. TkDiff is bundled
in for browsing and merging your changes.
