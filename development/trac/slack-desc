# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

trac: Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software
trac: development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to
trac: web-based software project management. Our mission is to help
trac: developers write great software while staying out of the way.
trac: Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established
trac: development process and policies.
