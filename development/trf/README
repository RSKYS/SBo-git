Trf extends the TCL language at the C-level with so-called 'transformer'
procedures. With the help of some patches to the core the package is
able to intercept all read/write operations on designated channels,
thus giving it the ability to transform the buffer contents as
desired. This allows things like transparent encryption, compression,
charset recoding, etc.
