txr (pattern-based text extraction language)

TXR is a pragmatic, convenient tool ready to take on your daily
hacking challenges with its dual personality: its whole-document
pattern matching and extraction language for scraping information from
arbitrary text sources, and its powerful data-processing language to
slice through problems like a hot knife through butter. Many tasks
can be accomplished with TXR "one liners" directly from your system
prompt. TXR is relatively new: the project started in 2009.

If you want to run the test suite, export MAKETESTS=yes in the
script's environment.
