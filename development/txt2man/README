txt2man (create man pages from plain text)

txt2man converts the input text into nroff/troff standard man(7)
macros used to format Unix manual pages. Nice pages can be generated
specially for commands (section 1 or 8) or for C functions reference
(sections 2, 3), with the ability to recognize and format command and
function names, flags, types and arguments.

txt2man is also able to recognize and format sections, paragraphs,
lists (standard, numbered, description, nested), cross references and
literal display blocks.
