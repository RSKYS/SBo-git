# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

unittest-cpp:
unittest-cpp: UnitTest++ is a lightweight unit testing framework for C++.
unittest-cpp: It was designed to do test-driven development on a wide variety of
unittest-cpp: platforms. Simplicity, portability, speed, and small footprint are
unittest-cpp: all very important aspects of UnitTest++. UnitTest++ is mostly
unittest-cpp: standard C++ and makes minimal use of advanced library and language
unittest-cpp: features, which means it should be easily portable to just about any
unittest-cpp: platform.
