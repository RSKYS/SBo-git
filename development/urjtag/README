UrJTAG aims to create an enhanced, modern tool for communicating over
JTAG with flash chips, CPUs, and many more. It takes on the well proven
openwince jtag tools code. Future plans include conversion of the code
base into a library that can be used with other applications.
A flexible remote communication protocol that can be used over almost
any type of serial link (including TCP/IP) is in the works.
