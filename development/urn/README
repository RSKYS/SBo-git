Urn is a new language developed by SquidDev, and demhydraz.
Urn is a Lisp dialect with a focus on minimalism which compiles to Lua.

What?
* A minimal[1] Lisp implementation, with full support for compile time
  code execution and macros.
* Support for Lua 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. Should also work with LuaJIT.
* Lisp-1 scoping rules (functions and data share the same namespace).
* Influenced by a whole range of Lisp implementations, including
  Common Lisp and Clojure.
* Produces standalone, optimised Lua files: no dependencies on a
  standard library.

[1]: Minimalism is an implementation detail.

Default urn works with lua 5.1.
You can set "URN_LUAVER" environment variable to change the lua version.
Example:

URN_LUAVER=5.3 for lua 5.3
URN_LUAVER=jit for luajit

Optional Dependency:
* lua-readline
For history completion
