vis (vi-like editor based on Plan 9's structural regular expressions)

Vis aims to be a modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient editor
combining the strengths of both vi(m) and sam. It extends vi's modal
editing with built-in support for multiple cursors/selections and
combines it with sam's structural regular expression based command
language. As an universal editor it has decent Unicode support
and should cope with arbitrary files including: large, binary or
single-line ones.
