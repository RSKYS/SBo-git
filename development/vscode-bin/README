VS Code is a type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code
editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug
cycle. It provides comprehensive editing and debugging support,
an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing
tools.

NOTE:
This package is a binary repackaging from the official package.
If you prefer to download from source, use vscode which is also
available from SBo.

32-bit version stays at version 1.35.1.
