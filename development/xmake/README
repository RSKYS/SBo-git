xmake is a cross-platform build utility based on Lua.

It can compile the project directly like Make/Ninja, or generate
project files like CMake/Meson, and it also has a built-in package
management system to help users solve the integrated use of C/C++
dependent libraries.

There are no dependencies, because xmake builds them on its own.
