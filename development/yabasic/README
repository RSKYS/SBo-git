yabasic is a traditional basic interpreter. It understands most of
the typical basic-constructs, like goto, gosub, line numbers, read,
data or string-variables with a trailing '$'. But on the other hand,
yabasic implements some more advanced programming-constructs like
subroutines or libraries (but not objects). yabasic works much the
same under Unix and Windows.

yabasic puts emphasis on giving results quickly and easily;
therefore simple commands are provided to open a graphic window,
print the graphics or control the console screen and get
keyboard or mouse information.
