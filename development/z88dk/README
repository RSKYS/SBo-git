z88dk (C cross compiler targetting the Z80)

z88dk is a z80 C cross compiler supplied with an assembler/linker and
a set of libraries implementing the C standard library for a number
of different z80 based machines. The name z88dk originates from the
time when the project was founded and targetted only the Cambridge z88
portable.

Very little documentation is shipped with z88dk, and what's present
is often outdated. For more extensive and updated docs, see the z88dk
wikis:
