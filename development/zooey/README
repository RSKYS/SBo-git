zooey (6502 cross-assembler for Atari 8-bit systems)

ZooEY is a cross assembler designed for 6502 processors. Binaries
are generated specially for 8-bit Atari systems (Atari DOS II and
SpartaDOS X formats supported). This tool is compatible with Quick
Assembler, one of most popular assemblers in Poland.

Also included are atari2unix and unix2atari (convert text files
between Atari and Unix line-endings) and syntax highlighting for
Midnight Commander (mcedit).
