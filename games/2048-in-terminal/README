2048-in-terminal (terminal-based 2048 clone)

This is a clone of the "2048" grid game written in C for the terminal.

Use the arrow or vi keys to move the blocks; other controls will appear
onscreen. A game can be continued after quitting the program. The high
score and game state are saved at $HOME/.2048.

A sliding effect for moving blocks can be toggled on and off in-game.
To have the program start with the animation turned off, use the
following parameter when calling the SlackBuild:

  DEFAULTSLIDE=no
