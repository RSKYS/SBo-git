Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries (7kaa)

Seven Kingdoms is a real-time strategy (RTS) computer game developed by 
Trevor Chan of Enlight Software. The game enables players to compete 
against up to six other kingdoms allowing players to conquer opponents 
by defeating them in war (with troops or machines), capturing their 
buildings with spies, or offering opponents money for their kingdom.

A long, long time ago, when people lived among gods and monsters, seven 
kingdoms struggled for rule over the land. Lead one of those 
civilizations to glory through sophisticated trade, diplomacy, 
espionage and conquest. Choose from one of seven cultures: Greek, 
Persian, Viking, Norman, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese and compete for 
domination. Each Race in Seven Kingdoms has its own distinct advantages 
and disadvantages, its own unique God unit, a different military skill, 
its own strengths and weaknesses. Learn how to use them! Use military 
means, economy or subterfuge to bring down your enemies. And don't 
forget about brute force, cunning and intelligence.

Conquer the world and build your empire!
