Chatbot-Eliza (Eliza chat bot interface module for Perl)

The original ELIZA program was written by Joseph Weizenbaum and
described in the Communications of the ACM in 1967.  Chatbot-Eliza is a
clone of the classic ELIZA program written as perl module. It prompts
for user input, and uses a simple transformation algorithm to change
user input into a fellow-up question.

The package includes some example scripts.
