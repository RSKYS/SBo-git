CorsixTH is an open source clone of the Bullfrog game Theme Hospital.
In it, you manage a hospital, research treatments, and cure patients
of diseases such as Slack Tongue and Bloaty Head.

To play CorsixTH, you will need a copy of Theme Hospital.
If you don't have Theme Hospital, you can buy it on GOG, or find
the free demo version. The first time you launch CorsixTH, it will
ask you to point it at the data files.

NOTE: to get music in-game, you need the fluid-soundfont package.
