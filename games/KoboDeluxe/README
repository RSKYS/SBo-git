KoboDeluxe (2d space shooting game)

Kobo is a game based on Xkobo. It is a 2D scrolling shooting game
where you must destroy every enemy starbase you find in each stage,
while avoiding being taken down by their defenses, the enemy ships,
the asteroids...

Gameplay is very similar to the classic arcade game Bosconian, from
1981.

The executable and man page are called "kobodl".
