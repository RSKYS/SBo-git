OpenJK is an effort by the JACoders group to maintain and improve
the game engines on which the Jedi Academy (JA) and Jedi Outcast (JO)
games run, while maintaining full backwards compatibility with the
existing games.

According to the official website, support for Jedi Outcast is
rudimentary and not very well tested, so it is not built by default.
If you want to build it, pass "BUILDJO=yes" on the command line.

You will need the game data from Jedi Academy. If you don't already own
Jedi Academy, you can buy it from online stores such as Steam, Amazon
or GOG.  Copy the contents of the GameData/base directory to
/opt/JediAcademy/base and/or /opt/JediOutcast/base.

By default, the games only support 4:3 resolutions. For modern monitors
you have to create /opt/JediAcademy/base/autoexec.cfg and/or
/opt/JediOutcast/base/autoexec.cfg (change the resolution and FOV to
your needs):

set r_customWidth "1360"
set r_customHeight "768"
set r_mode "-1"
vid_restart
cg_fov "97"
cg_fovaspectadjust 1
