OpenRA is a modernized recreation of the classic RTS Command & Conquer

OpenRA is a project that recreates and modernizes the classic Command &
Conquer real time strategy games. A flexible open source game engine
(the OpenRA engine), has been developed, which provides a common
platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games
(the OpenRA mods).

NOTE: There is a known issue with the version of mono found at
SlackBuilds.org and some terminals, such as urxvt, that affects OpenRA
during build time and run time; one work around is to pass the varible
TERM=xterm to the script during build and run time.
