PyLotRO is a launcher for The Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons
and Dragons Online for Linux and Mac OSX. This application gives a
graphical interface that allows both starting and patching/updating
the game when installed in Wine.

The homepage for PyLotRO disappeared some time ago, but no further
development appears to be necessary.

PyLotRO does not have any extra build dependencies beyond those 
present in a full install of Slackware, but wine is required to
actually play either LOTRO or DDO.
