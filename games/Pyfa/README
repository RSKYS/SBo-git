Pyfa is a cross-platform desktop fitting application for EVE online
that can be used natively on any platform where python and wxwidgets
are available. It provides many advanced features such as graphs and
full calculations of any possible combination of modules, fits, etc.

Optional dependencies used for graphing tool, available on SBo:
libraries/matplotlib - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
development/numpy - http://numpy.scipy.org/

This SlackBuild installs pyfa to /opt/Pyfa-<version> and then
symlinks /usr/bin/pyfa to the /opt/Pyfa-<version>/pyfa.py run script.
Removing Pyfa via the package manager may not remove all templates from
the directory and therefore may require additional manual deletion of
the /opt/Pyfa-<version> folder.
