Tempus-Irae (game data for use with alephone package)

Tempus Irae, a new scenario in the Marathon universe built upon
the Marathon Infinity engine. In Tempus Irae the player travels
back in time... to Renaissance Italy.

Tempus Irae combines over twenty-two thousand polygons of solo
maps with literally hundreds of new textures. New sounds, scenery
items, and shapes are combined with gorgeous terminal pictures and
chapter screens, as well as a first-rate script.

The Aleph One version of Tempus Irae includes both Tempus Irae and
Tempus Irae 2: The Lost Levelsi.

Included in the package is a shell script wrapper. Type "tempus-irae"
or select Tempus Irae from the KDE or XFCE "Games" menu.

The Tempus_Premium_Landscapes.zip archive is optional and if present the
Tempus Irae Enhanced Hi Res Landscapes will be installed too. This will
require at least 64mb VRAM to be available.

To install the gamedata in /opt instead of /usr to save space in the
root partition use:

  OPT=yes ./Tempus-Irae.SlackBuild
