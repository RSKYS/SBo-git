UrbanTerror is an urban combat themed First Person Shooter.
Urban Terror started as a realism based "total conversion" mod for 
Quake III Arena. Nowadays, Urban Terror is played using the free, 
stand-alone, ioquake3 engine modified, which doesn't require 
Quake III Arena.

To build a 32bit package pass ARCH=i386 to the script, ie
$ ARCH=i386 ./UrbanTerror.SlackBuild

Please note:

If you have a previous version of UrbanTerror installed please don't
use upgradekg with this package. Use removepkg to remove the previous
version first since the paths may differ.
