Abuse is a dark 2D side-scrolling platform game developed by Crack dot
Com in 1995. It features beautiful lighting, realistic animation and
nasty alien-like creatures to destroy.
It is now maintained by Sam Hocevar in an attempt to prevent it from
vanishing from the Internet.

If sound doesn't work for you or it is distorted, apply the supplied
patch with:

SOUNDFIX=YES ./abuse.SlackBuild

Optionally, for in-game music support you need to install TiMidity++
(and a set of sound patches for it).
