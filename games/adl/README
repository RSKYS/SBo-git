adl (compiler and runtime for adventure definition language)

ADL stands for Adventure Definition Language. It is a superset, with
greatly enhanced capabilities, of an older language named DDL. DDL was
originally written in 1981 by Michael Urban, Chris Kostanick, Michael
Stein, Bruce Adler, and Warren Usui, all of the UCLA Computer Club.

Includes compiler (adlcomp), runtime (adlrun), debugger (adldebug),
and two sample games (aard and mpu). Documentation and sample code is
installed in /usr/doc/adl-$VERSION. Also, the ADL Programmer's Reference
Manual is available at: http://adl.sourceforge.net/

The package includes 3 versions of ADL, for maximum compatibility. See
README_versions.txt for details.
