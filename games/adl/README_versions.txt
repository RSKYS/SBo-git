ADL has a long history, and both the source and compilied bytecode
formats have changed several times in incompatible ways.

This package includes 3 versions of ADL:

adl93: The version found in the Interactive Fiction Archive. This is
mainly included for historical interest. Confusingly enough, even though
this version dates from 1993, adlcomp93's banner reports "Version 3.2 -
June 7, 1987".

adl03: The only sourceforge.net release done by the author. Most Windows
users will be using this version, since it's the only version released
as a Windows executable. If you want to share games with Windows users,
this is the version to use. Banner reports "Version 4.1 - January 25,
2002. This package installs these in /usr/games as adlcomp, adlrun,
adldebug.

adl11: Last development version by the author, from sourceforge CVS. This
version has more and better documentation than the earlier versions,
and might be a good choice for a new game if Windows compatibility isn't
an issue. Banner reports "Version 5.0 - May 1, 2004".
