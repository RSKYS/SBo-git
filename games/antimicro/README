Antimicro is a GUI application to intercept gamepad signals and
translate them to keyboard and mouse events, so that you can use a
gamepad with games that do not have native (or poor) gamepad support.

It works for games you're playing on Linux or with WINE. It works with
Steam or stand-alone games.

Profiles
--------

Some pre-built game controller profiles are available here:

These allow you to download button mappings for popular games so that
you don't have to configure them yourself.
