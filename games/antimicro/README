Antimicro is a GUI application to intercept gamepad signals and
translate them to keyboard and mouse events, so that you can use a
gamepad with games that do not have native (or poor) gamepad support.

It works for games you're playing on Linux or with WINE. It works with
Steam or stand-alone games.

You can compile it using Qt4 or Qt5, at your option. Default is
the Slackware default: Qt4. To compile with Qt5 instead:

    # QT=5 ./antimicro.SlackBuild


Profiles
--------

Some pre-built game controller profiles are available here:

https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro-profiles

These allow you to download button mappings for popular games so that
you don't have to configure them yourself.
