AssaultCube Reloaded, formerly AssaultCube Special Edition, 
is a free-and-open-source first-person-shooter, created by 
the AssaultCube Reloaded Task Force to improve AssaultCube.

This game combines the best of all worlds. Realism from Battlefield, 
anti-cheat inspired by the Quake engine, perks from Call of Duty, 
mutators from Red Eclipse, and fast-paced gameplay 
with a low system footprint from AssaultCube and the Cube Engine.
