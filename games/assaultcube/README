Formerly ActionCube, is a free first-person-shooter
based on the game Cube. Set in a realistic looking
environment, as far as that's possible with this
engine, while gameplay stays fast and arcade.

Note: If upgrading from version 1.1 or earlier then the new
directory "~/.assaultcube_v1.2" will be created and previous
settings will not be applied to new version.
