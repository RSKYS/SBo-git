atari800 (Atari 8-bit computer emulator)

This is a free and portable Atari 8-bit computer and 5200 console
emulator, originally written by David Firth and now developed by the
Atari800 Development Team. This program is copyrighted and released
under the GPL.

This build uses SDL for audio, and SDL+OpenGL for video by default. To
build without OpenGL support (SDL software rendering only), set
OPENGL=no in the script's environment.

Starting with version 4.0.0, atari800 includes free replacements
for the system ROMs, from the Altirra project. This allows
you to run most Atari software without installing the original
ROMs. However, for maximum compatibility, you'll need the Atari
system ROMs. These are packaged on SBo as atari800_roms. After
installing the ROMs, use the built-in menu in atari800 to set the paths
(/usr/share/atari800/atari800_roms/*) and disable the built-in Altirra
ROMs.

When upgrading from 3.x to 4.x, if the Atari's display is 'washed out'
(too bright), remove your old "~/.atari800.cfg".
