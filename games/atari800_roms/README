atari800_roms (system ROMs for Atari 8-bit computers)

The operating system and BASIC language ROM images from the
Atari 800 and 800XL computers. The ROM images are installed in
/usr/share/atari800/, for use with the atari800 emulator, but may be
used with other emulators such as Atari++.

Also included are bootable disk images for Atari DOS 2.5 and MyDOS
4.5d, and a couple of disks of demo software. These are installed in
/usr/share/atari800/disks.

These ROM images are proprietary and copyrighted, but the copyright
holder granted the right to redistribute them to the authors of PC
Xformer, a (now obsolete) Atari emulator. This build extracts the ROMs
from the PC Xformer zip file.
