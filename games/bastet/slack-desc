# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bastet: stands for "bastard tetris", and is a simple ncurses-based Tetris(R)
bastet: clone for Linux. Instead of choosing the next block randomly, this
bastet: fiendish program uses a special algorithm to give you the worst
bastet: possible brick. Playing Bastet can be a very frustrating experience!
