Berusky II (Bugs Escape 3D) is our second finished project. We adopted
the idea and the basic logical building blocks of the game from the
first part. The technical processing, however, has seen major changes
since the first part. The entire game takes place in a 3D environment
which brings along many advantages. In addition to arbitrary turning
and level zooming, the main advantage is especially the new structure
of logical plots which, thanks to the 3D technology, happen in space.
