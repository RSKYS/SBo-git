# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

berusky2:
berusky2: Berusky II (Bugs Escape 3D) is our second finished project.
berusky2: We adopted the idea and the basic logical building blocks
berusky2: of the game from the first part. The technical processing,
berusky2: however, has seen major changes since the first part. The
berusky2: entire game takes place in a 3D environment which brings
berusky2: along many advantages.
