BlueZ provides support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols. It
is flexible, efficient and uses a modular implementation.

This package provides only the sixaxis plugin (missing from the main
Slackware bluez release). It plugs into the existing bluez package
which, as part of main Slackware, is expected to be installed already.

To enable the sixaxis plugin after installation, you may need to
restart Slackware or, at the very least, restart the system bluetooth
facililties via the /etc./rc.d/rc.bluetooth script.
