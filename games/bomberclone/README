This game, i hope it will soon be a good Clone of the game
AtomicBomberMan or even something new, depends on what you all want to
have. The Network will support from the beginning only TCP/IP (UDP Port
11000 for the Game and UDP Port 11111 for the OpenGameCache Server). So
everyone can play it over the internet.
