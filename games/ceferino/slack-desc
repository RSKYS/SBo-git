# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ceferino: ceferino (2d balloon-breaking game)
ceferino:
ceferino: A game similar to 'Super Pang'. You are attacked by little green
ceferino: balls which are bouncing around and which you have to destroy with
ceferino: your knife. Your knife however is limited to being thrown upwards,
ceferino: thus you have to get under the balls to destroy them. Even worse,
ceferino: if you destroy a large ball, it doesn't just vanish, but breaks apart
ceferino: into two smaller balls. Levels consist of little platforms connected
ceferino: by ladders, so you can go up and down or find cover if needed.
