Chocolate Doom is a Doom source port that accurately reproduces the
experience of Doom and Doom II as they were played in the 1990s.

Chocolate Doom also supports Heretic, Hexen, Strife, and Chex Quest.

To play chocolate-doom, you need at least one of:
  doom2.wad from Doom II
  doom.wad from Registered Doom or Ultimate Doom
  tnt.wad or plutonia.wad from Final Doom
  doom1.wad from Shareware Doom (games/doom_shareware_data on SBo)
  freedoom.wad from FreeDoom (games/freedoom on SBo)

For chocolate-heretic:
  heretic.wad from Registered Heretic
  heretic1.wad from Shareware Heretic (games/heretic_shareware_data)

For chocolate-hexen:
  hexen.wad from Registered Hexen
  hexdemo.wad from the Hexen demo (games/hexen_demo_data on SBo)

For chocolate-strife:
  strife1.wad from Registered Strife

Place the WAD file(s) in /usr/share/games/doom.

For Chex Quest, get chex.wad from the game, and chex.deh from
https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/utils/exe_edit/patches/chexdeh, place
them both in /usr/share/games/doom, and run:

chocolate-doom -iwad chex.wad

The Strife demo (strife0.wad) doesn't work with Chocolate Doom.
Chex Quest 2 and 3 are not supported.
