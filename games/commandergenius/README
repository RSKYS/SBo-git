commandergenius (engine for Commander Keen games)

Commander Genius is an open-source clone of Commander Keen which allows
you to play the games, and some of the mods made for it. All of the
original data files are required to do so, however the authors have
provided convenient way to download some of the games (choose "More"
at the main menu). It's also possible to use the data files from an
installed copy of one or more of the games.

Supported games include:

Keen 1 - Version 1.33 [*]
Keen 2 - Version 1.33
Keen 3 - Version 1.33
Keen 4 - Version 1.4 (EGA) [*]
Keen 5 - Version 1.4 (EGA)
Keen 6 - Version 1.4 (EGA) (version 1.5 known not to work!)
Keen 7 [*]
Keen Dreams - Version v1.13 (EGA) [*]

[*] = downloadable from within the UI.

Other versions might work, but there are no guarantees. For the games
not available via the in-game downloader, place the data files somewhere
under /usr/share/games/commandergenius or ~/.CommanderGenius, and edit
~/.CommanderGenius/games.cfg to tell the game where to find the files.

commandergenius also has a HQP (High Quality Pack) with enhanced
graphics and sound for Keen 1 through 4. For Keen 1 and Keen 4,
choose "Keen 1 Special" and "Keen 4 Special" from the Game Center,
to get the HQP versions of the games. For Keen 2 and Keen 3,
the HQP will automatically be used if the games are installed to
~/.CommanderGenius/games/keen2 and ~/.CommanderGenius/games/keen3,
with games.cfg entries like so:

&Dir=games/keen2/keen2.exe
/Name=keen2

&Dir=games/keen3/keen3.exe
/Name=keen3

If you *don't* want the HQP to be used, use different directory names
for the above (e.g. ckeen2 and ckeen3).

Note: When upgrading to version 2.2.2, you may have to delete your old
config. The SlackBuild author had to do this to get audio to work:

$ rm -rf ~/.CommanderGenius/
