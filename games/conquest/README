Conquest is a real-time, multi-player space warfare game that 
was originally written in RATFOR for the VAX/VMS platform by 
Jef Poskanzer and Craig Leres. It was the early predecessor to 
Netrek. This page concerns itself with the Unix/C rewrite I 
completed in 1997. With conquest version 8.1 or better, an OpenGL 
based client is provided as well, which looks a heck of alot 
better than the 20th Century curses interface it started with :).

Conquest will need a conquest group to run. You can add one with
# groupadd -g 294 conquest
