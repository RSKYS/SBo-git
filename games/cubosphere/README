Goal of this project is a remake of the Playstation 1 Game "Kula World"
/ "Roll Away". It is designed platform independend, written in C++ and
using the following libraries: OpenGL, SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer),
libjpeg, LUA, GLSL-Shader.

Note: In order to load the background music (eg. loading *.mp3 files),
install smpeg and then rebuild the sdl package that comes with
Slackware.
