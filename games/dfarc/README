DFArc is a frontend for freedink. It lets you install and manage
additional D-Mods for freedink.

Known issues:
- Freedink might start in a maximized, not resizable window. Parts of
  it may be outside the Desktop. If this happens then start the
  program windowed mode by ticking the corresponding checkbox in DFArc.
  Afterwards you can switch to fullscreen by pressing Alt+Enter.

Optional dependency:
- upx
  If upx is installed on the system then it is automatically
  detected and considered at compile time.

  If for some reason this is not desired then the script
  should be called as

    ENABLE_UPX=no ./dfarc.Slackbuild

  If UPX resides in a non-standard location then it
  can be provided by setting

    UPX=/path/to/upx ./dfarc.Slackbuild
