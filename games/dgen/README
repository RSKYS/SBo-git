DGen/SDL is a free, open source emulator for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive
systems. DGen was originally written by Dave, then ported to SDL by
Joe Groff and Phil K. Hornung in 1998.

DGen isn't the best Mega Drive/Genesis emulator out there, but it works
and it's probably the most portable. It's also perfect for command-line
freaks.
