Dolphin is a Gamecube, Wii and Triforce (the arcade machine based on
the Gamecube) emulator which supports many extra features and
abilities not present on the original consoles. Gamecube and Wii
compatibility is good - one can expect "mainstream" titles to run;
lesser known titles can be hit or miss. Triforce compatibility is
currently limited to a couple of games - others require more of the
Triforce-specific peripheral devices to be emulated.

Optional dependencies: SFML, portaudio, soil, miniupnpc, soundtouch,
