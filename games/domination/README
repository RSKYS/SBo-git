domination (clone of the board game Risk)

Domination is a game that is a bit like the well known board game of
Risk or RisiKo. It has many game options and includes many maps.

Domination is written in Java. It includes a map editor, single-player
vs. AI, networked multiplayer, and many other features. It works in all
OSes that run Java 1.4 or higher, and Android.

Since Domination is a Java application, it will require a Java Virtual
Machine to run. Any of these SBo builds will work:

jdk
openjdk
openjdk6
openjdk8

All of the above install scripts in /etc/profile.d, meaning you must
log out and back in to run Java applications (including Domination).
