domination (clone of the board game Risk)

Domination is a game that is a bit like the well known board game of
Risk or RisiKo. It has many game options and includes many maps.

Domination is written in Java. It includes a map editor, single-player
vs. AI, networked multiplayer, and many other features. It works in all
OSes that run Java 1.4 or higher, and Android.

Since Domination is a Java application, it will require a Java
Virtual Machine to run. It has been tested with zulu-openjdk8 and
zulu-openjdk11. Other JDK builds (e.g. jdk or openjdk) may work, but
the SlackBuild author hasn't tested them.
