# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

doomretro:
doomretro: DOOM Retro is the classic, refined DOOM source port. It represents
doomretro: what DOOM should be today, in all its dark, gritty, unapologetically
doomretro: pixellated glory. DOOM Retro's source code is forked from
doomretro: Chocolate DOOM, with enhancements from other DOOM source ports, as
doomretro: well as many orignal ideas. DOOM Retro is deliberately minimalist
doomretro: by design, and does a few things differently when compared with
doomretro: other source ports.
