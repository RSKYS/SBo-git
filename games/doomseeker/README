doomseeker (server browser for Doom and related games)

Doomseeker is a cross-platform server browser for Doom and related
games. The goal of Doomseeker is to provide a smooth, consistent
experience for players regardless of port or platform. Doomseeker
provides support for Chocolate Doom, Odamex, Zandronum[*], Sonic Robo
Blast 2 (aka srb2), and Turok 2 Remastered[*].

The first time you run Doomseeker, you will have tell it the location
of your game engine binaries and IWAD files. It won't look in your
PATH for the binaries, they'll be in either /usr/bin, /usr/games, or
similar. If you don't know where your IWAD file(s) are located, try
/usr/share/games/doom.

This requires one or more of chocolate-doom, odamex, or srb2: to be
useful for anything, it needs at least one supported game engine.

[*] Not currently available from SBo. If you package one of these,
please let me know so I can update this README.
