Dopewars is a free Unix/Win32 rewrite of a game originally based on
"Drug Wars" by John E. Dell. The idea of dopewars is to deal in drugs
on the streets of New York, amassing a huge fortune and paying off
the loan shark, while avoiding the ever-annoying police.
The Unix/Win32 rewrite, as well as featuring a so-called "antique"
mode which closely follows the original, introduces new features such
as the ability to take part in multi-player games. dopewars aims to be
highly configurable, and what you can't change in the configuration
files you can change by poking around in the source, which is freely
available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
