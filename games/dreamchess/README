DreamChess features 3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board
sets, ranging from classic wooden to flat.  A moderately strong chess
engine is included: Dreamer.  However, should this engine be too weak
for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible chess engine,
including the popular Crafty and GNU Chess.  Other features include
on-screen move lists using SAN notation, undo functionality, and
savegames in PGN format.
