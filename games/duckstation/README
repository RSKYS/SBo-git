DuckStation is an simulator/emulator of the Sony PlayStation(TM)
console, focusing on playability, speed, and long-term
maintainability. The goal is to be as accurate as possible while
maintaining performance suitable for low-end devices. "Hack" options
are discouraged, the default configuration should support all playable
games with only some of the enhancements having compatibility issues.

A "BIOS" ROM image is required to to start the emulator and to play
games. You can use an image from any hardware version or region,
although mismatching game regions and BIOS regions may have
compatibility issues. A ROM image is not provided with the emulator
for legal reasons, you should dump this from your own console using
Caetla or other means.

Discord Rich Presence is disabled by default, to enable Discord
functionality, pass DISCORD=ON to the build script.
