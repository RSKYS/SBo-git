dungeon (text adventure game)

This "mainframe zork" has everything contained in the commercial ZORK
I, part of ZORK II, and the endgame from ZORK III. Some mainframe
computers don't have this full version, so if your mainframe doesn't
have the endgame, the Bank of Zork, and the puzzle room, you are in for
some new challenges.

This version of Dungeon seems to be earlier than any of the ones
available at www.if-archive.org. It was posted to USEnet ages ago. This
build uses slightly modified sources, needed to get modern GNU Fortran
to compile them.

BTW, the source files say copyright INFOCOM, but allow non-commercial
use.  This was the last version before INFOCOM went commercial.

This build includes the game map in /usr/doc/dungeon-$VERSION

You can build a debugging (aka cheating) version of Dungeon by passing
DEBUG=yes in the script's environment. This enables tracing and the GDT
command.
