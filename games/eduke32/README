EDuke32 is a fork of the JFDuke3D port of Duke Nukem 3D (aka Duke3D),
merging it with EDuke to provide many new features for mod authors.
Also included is a map editor (mapster32).

To play the game, you will need the DUKE32.GRP file from either
the Duke Nukem 3D CD-ROM, or from the shareware version of Duke
Nukem 3D.  For convenience, the shareware GRP file has been packaged
as eduke32_shareware_data, also available from slackbuilds.org.
See README_game_data.txt

eduke32 is an SDL application. It can be built with either SDL 1.2
(included in Slackware), or SDL 2 (from SlackBuilds.org). By default,
SDL 2 is used if it's installed, otherwise SDL 1.2 is used. To force
building with SDL 1.2, export SDL2=no in the environment before
building eduke32.

If you want to play the HRP (High Resolution Pack), get the
eduke32_hires_pack package from slackbuilds.org.

To hear the in-game music, either use the Music Pack (see
eduke32_hires_pack), or else install a set of MIDI patches (either
freepats or eawpats) from slackbuilds.org. The game looks for
/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg, but timidity doesn't actually have to be
installed.

By default, the Build utilities (kextract kgroup transpal wad2art
wad2map) are built by this script and installed in /usr/games. If you
don't want these, you can set BUILD_UTILS=no in the environment before
running the SlackBuild script.

Note for 64-bit users: Despite the "32" in the name, this software
builds and runs just fine as 64-bit native binaries :)
