The Duke3D High Resolution Pack allows you to use much better looking
textures than the original game (released back in 1996) had to offer
in the first place. It also introduces 3D model replacements for the
old enemies/weapons/items sprites. In combination with an OpenGL port
like JFDuke3D or EDuke32, this gives Duke Nukem 3D a modernized, more
appealing look and even motivates Duke veterans to play through the
original episodes once again.

This package is intended for use with the eduke32 package from
slackbuilds.org, but may also be used with other Duke3D source ports.

Optionally, this package can include the EDuke32 Music Pack, which
provides better-sounding music than the default MIDI soundtrack. To
include the music pack, download the file from:

http://www.duke4.org/files/nightfright/music/duke3d_music-sc55.zip

...and save it in the same directory as the SlackBuild.

If you've installed this package, but for some reason want to run
eduke32 without it, run "eduke32 -noautoload".
