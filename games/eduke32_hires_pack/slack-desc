# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

eduke32_hires_pack: eduke32_hires_pack (Duke3D High Resolution Pack)
eduke32_hires_pack: The Duke3D High Resolution Pack allows you to use much better looking
eduke32_hires_pack: textures than the original game (released back in 1996) had to offer
eduke32_hires_pack: in the first place. It also introduces 3D model replacements for
eduke32_hires_pack: the old enemies/weapons/items sprites. In combination with an OpenGL
eduke32_hires_pack: port like JFDuke3D or EDuke32, this gives Duke Nukem 3D a modernized,
eduke32_hires_pack: more appealing look and even motivates Duke veterans to play through
eduke32_hires_pack: the original episodes once again.
eduke32_hires_pack:
eduke32_hires_pack: This package is intended for use with the eduke32 package from
eduke32_hires_pack: slackbuilds.org, but may also be used with other Duke3D source ports.
