EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE) is a frontend application for
browsing and launching games from your multi-platform game collection.
It comes preconfigured for use with RetroArch and a large selection of
standalone emulators. It's also fully customizable so you can easily
expand it to include emulators or applications not covered by the
bundled configuration.
ES-DE is true multi-platform and runs on numerous operating systems such
as Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, SteamOS, Arch Linux, Raspberry Pi OS,
Manjaro, Linux Mint, Fedora and FreeBSD.
EmulationStation needs RetroArch.
