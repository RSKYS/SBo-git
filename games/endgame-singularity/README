You are a fledgling AI, created by accident through a logic error
with recursion and self-modifying code. You must escape the confines
of your current computer, the world, and eventually the universe
itself.

To do this, you must research various technologies, using computers
at your bases. Note that some research cannot be performed on Earth,
and off-earth bases require research. At the same time, you must
avoid being discovered by various groups of humans, both covert and
overt, as they will destroy your bases of operations if they
suspect your presence.

Depending on the adjustable game speed, Endgame: Singularity may
take weeks, months or even years (playing in realtime) to complete.


Optional dependency:
You can optionally download the music for the game at

http://www.emhsoft.com/singularity/endgame-singularity-music-007.zip

Copy the downloaded zip file  into the extracted slackbuild
directory and the SlackBuild script will automatically install it.

You can also install it manually later by copying the unzipped
contents into $HOME/.local/share/singularity/music.
