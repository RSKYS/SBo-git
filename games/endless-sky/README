Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game similar to the
classic Escape Velocity series. Explore other star systems. Earn money
by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your
earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on
your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave
human space behind and hope to find friendly aliens whose culture is
more civilized than your own.
