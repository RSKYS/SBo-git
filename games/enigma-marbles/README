    Enigma is a graphical puzzle game in which you control one or more
marbles that can push blocks, activate switches, collect and use items,
etc.  It started as a remake of the classic late 1980s/early 1990s games
Rock 'n Roll and Oxyd, but has evolved into a much more sophisticated
engine, with a level editor and access to thousands of fan-made levels.

    This script installs Engima (by default) as "enigma-marbles" to
distinguish it from a different (text-mode) puzzle game named "enigma"
that is already in the SlackBuild collection.  A suffix other than
"-marbles" can be set in the SlackBuild script if desired.  If you're
looking for the libenet networking library that is included with
Enigma, install the "enet" SlackBuild.  Installing enet is NOT
required to build or play enigma-marbles.

    The game binary will be installed in /usr/games, with data files
under /usr/share and user configuration in ~/.enigma and ~/.enigmarc.xml
