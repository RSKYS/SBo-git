ezQuake is a modern QuakeWorld client Combining the features 
of all modern QuakeWorld clients, ezQuake makes QuakeWorld 
easier to start and play. 

ezQuake is only a game engine modification; you still need the
original quake *.pak game files to play ezQuake.  Save the 
pak files in /usr/share/games/ezquake/id1.
