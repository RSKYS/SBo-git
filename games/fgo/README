FGo! is a simple and fast graphical front end for FlightGear, written
in Python by Robert Leda. It combines a simple graphical interface,
where users can select an aircraft, airport, runway, parking position
and scenario, with a text window which provides a way to specify more
advanced command-line options that will be passed to FlightGear. These
features allow FGo! to keep a minimalist but powerful design.
