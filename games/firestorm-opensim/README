Firestorm Viewer is an alternative client program for SecondLife, a
virtual world developed by Linden Lab accessible via the internet.

Firestorm Viewer is based on Linden Lab's Viewer versions 2 and 3.
It has loads of new and innovative features added to improve
performance, increase usability, and generally enhance the user's
overall experience.

Firestorm Viewer is a 32 bit application and does not run on standard
64 bit systems.

NOTE: Version 4.4.2 is an emergency correction for version 4.4.1 which 
has been blocked from logging on to the SecondLife grid.

NOTE: Linden Lab have stated they intend to begin rolling out Server 
Side Appearance (formerly known as Server Side Baking) on July 9th 
or shortly thereafter. It is of paramount importance that all 
Firestorm users upgrade to 4.4.2 before the 9th of July.

NOTE: the Phoenix Firestorm project require that you do a clean
install when upgrading to version 4.4.2 from a previous version. 
A detailed documention of the procedure is available at 
http://wiki.phoenixviewer.com/doku.php?id=fs_clean_reinstall .

NOTE: this SlackBuild is made for the Opensim release of Firestorm. 
It can be used for the Second Life main grid and beta grid as well.
However, if you require those features specific to the Havoc release
of Firestorm you should use the standard release of Firestorm for 
which a separate package is available. Both packages can be installed 
in parallel on the same Slackware installation.
