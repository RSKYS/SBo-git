Firestorm Viewer is an alternative client program for SecondLife, a
virtual world developed by Linden Lab accessible via the internet.

Firestorm Viewer is based on Linden Lab's Viewer versions 2 and 3.
It has loads of new and innovative features added to improve
performance, increase usability, and generally enhance the user's
overall experience.

Firestorm Viewer is available as 32 bit and as 64 bit application.

NOTE: Since release 4.7.9 there is no Havoc version of Firestorm.
Therefore this package now builds the Opensim version by default.
