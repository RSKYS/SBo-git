fizmo (Z-Code interpreter for Infocom and other story files)

Fizmo provides a Z-Machine interpreter development library in plain C
along with a ncurses user interface, supporting Z-Machine versions 1
to 5, 7 and 8. That means it allows you to play interactive fiction,
also known as text adventures, which were implemented either by Infocom
or created using the Inform compiler.

By default, the curses (fizmo-ncursesw) and 'dumb' console
(fizmo-console) executables are always built.

Optional dependencies: these are auto-detected at build time, so just
install them before building fizmo if you want to use them. If you have
one of these installed but don't want to build fizmo with it, disable
it with the appropriate environment variable.

SDL2     - Recommended. Required for Z-Machine games that use graphics
           and/or sound. Builds fizmo-sdl2 executable. Also adds sound
           support to fizmo-ncursesw. Can be disabled with SDL2=no in
           the environment.

glktermw - Required for experimental fizmo-glktermw executable. Probably
           only of interest to developers. Can be disabled with GLK=no
           in the environment.

remglk   - Required for experimental fizmo-remglk executable. Probably
           only of interest to developers. Can be disabled with
           REMGLK=no in the environment.
