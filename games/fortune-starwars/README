fortune-starwars (Star Wars fortune file)

fortune-starwars is a collection of quotes from the movies "Star Wars",
"The Empire Strikes Back", and "Return Of The Jedi". It is meant for
use with the fortune program. It does not contain quotes from Episodes
One to Three, because the author doesn't really like them.

To see a Star Wars fortune, type: fortune starwars

To add Star Wars fortunes to the random login fortunes, edit
/etc/profile.d/bsd-games-login-fortune.sh and add "starwars" to the list

...and may also contain other fortune files installed by other packages
