freedoom (Free Software replacement for Doom/Doom2 game data)

The Freedoom project aims to create a complete Doom-based game which is
Free Software. Combined with a free source port, people will also be
able to play the back catalog of extensions made to Doom by hobbyists
over the last 15 years.

Freedoom requires a Doom engine to play, such as zdoom (available from
slackbuilds.org). It does NOT require the original Doom or Doom II IWAD
files, since it is a replacement for them.

This package installs 3 wad files in /usr/share/games/doom:

freedoom1.wad  - Replacement IWAD for Doom I and Ultimate Doom.
freedoom2.wad  - Replacement IWAD for Doom II and Final Doom.
freedm.wad     - Standalone deathmatch-only level pack.

To use these data files with zdoom, simply build and install this
package.  You will be prompted for which IWAD file to use (which
game to play) when starting zdoom. Other Doom source ports may do the
same, or may require a command-line option to set the IWAD file. Some
engines may require symlinking "freedoom2.wad" to "doom2.wad" and
"freedoom1.wad" to "doom.wad".
