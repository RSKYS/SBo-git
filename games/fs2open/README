The FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project is the project of a group of
programmers currently maintaining and enhancing the game engine for the
space combat simulator FreeSpace 2, developed by Volition, Inc.

You will need the game data from FreeSpace 2. If you don't already own
FreeSpace 2, you can buy it from online stores such as Steam, Amazon
or GOG.

Copy the data directories and all .vp files into ~/.fs2_open for the
game to work.

Notice for Intel cards: You may need to export
'MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2' if the game doesn't run.
