1945 is a simple top-down shooter that uses non-original
graphics from SpriteLib GPL. The game is solidly programmed,
but the gameplay fails in many ways. 1945 doesn't feature any
level-based progress only an increase of difficulty. It was
reported by most players that the game is too easy and virtually
never becomes truly challenging.
