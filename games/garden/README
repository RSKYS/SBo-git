Garden of coloured lights is an old school 2D vertical shoot-em-up
with some innovative elements. Innovative graphics, soundtrack and game
concept. The game itself is very challenging and as you progress, you
will understand that you are dealing with a true piece of art...

It is not an easy game, so you will need some skill and patience... And
maybe you will appreciate the possibility to use a joystick. And yes,
it is actually possible to get to stage 4 :-)
