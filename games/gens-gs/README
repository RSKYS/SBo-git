Gens/GS is a Sega Genesis/CD/32x emulator forked from Gens.

The project's main goal is to clean up the source code and combine
features of the various Gens forks, as well as improve portability to
other platforms.

To build without OpenGL, run the script like:

  OPENGL=no ./gens-gs.SlackBuild

To build with the yasm assembler instead of nasm, run the script like:

  ASM=yasm ./gens-gs.SlackBuild

rar is an optional run-time dependency for playing ROMs compressed with
WinRAR.
