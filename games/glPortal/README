glPortal (3d physics based portal puzzle game)

GlPortal is not a Portal clone; it features its own story centered
around an ambitious lab assistant named Ada, who has to solve
dangerous tasks for science on a daily basis. Her sidekick, a know-it-
all Robot with a more than impressive laser canon, and an overexcited
professor support her in her mission. Most of the time she has to
dodge lasers and bullets while preventing the destruction of all life
on earth. She is aided in her quest by the newest gizmo created by the
engineers downstairs.
