hack-of-life (networked multiplayer curses Conway's Life variant)

hack-of-life is a modified version of Conway's Game of Life that has
multiple colors of cells. The object of the game is to defeat other
players by eliminating their cells, and/or cover over 1/3 of the board
with cells of your color.

Considering how Life is a zero-player game, it makes it lots of fun
as a curiosity, but makes it very easy for people who are not Life
enthusiasts to quickly become bored after watching yet another glider
explode.

So this decides to put the Game back in the Game of Life. And it does
that by taking the interface of the RogueLike genre of computer games
and terribly abusing it. The name of the game is adopted from the
RogueLike giant NetHack, resulting in the Hack of Life.

Note: the executable is called "hackoflife" (not "hack-of-life" like
the package name).
