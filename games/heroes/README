heroes (2d arcade style game)

Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but
includes many graphical improvements and new game features. In it,
you must maneuver a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups
while avoiding obstacles, your opponents' trails, and even your own
trail.

The game starts in fullscreen mode when called with no arguments.
Pressing Alt+Enter will toggle between fullscreen and windowed, and
you can pass the -W option to start in windowed mode (the .desktop
file does this already).

To play with the joystick, you have to set the player 1 controls to
Joystick in the menu. Should be obvious, but the in-game menus are
kinda hard to read...
