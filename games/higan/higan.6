.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
higan [\-\-fullscreen] [GAME [SUBGAME1 [SUBGAME2]]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
When launched with \-\-fullscreen, higan will automatically enter fullscreen mode
when it starts, otherwise it starts in windowed mode. This is not much use
unless you also specify GAME, because you won\(aqt be able to load a game until you
exit fullscreen mode by pressing the "Toggle Fullscreen" hotkey.
.sp
When GAME is not given, higan starts with no game loaded.
.sp
When GAME is the path to an existing game folder for any supported console, that
game will automatically be loaded after higan starts.
.sp
When GAME is the path to a ROM file for any supported console, it will be
imported into a game folder in the Game Library, and loaded from there after
higan starts.
.sp
When GAME is of the form REGION|PATH (that is, a region code, a vertical bar
(|), and a path to a game folder or ROM file) higan will load the game at PATH
into the REGION variant of the appropriate console, rather than detecting which
variant the game expects. This is the command\-line equivalent of choosing a
region from the drop\-down in the bottom\-right of the filesystem browser window
when you load a game from the game library. The list of region codes differs
from console to console, so load a game from the library and check the list
before loading it from the command\-line.
.sp
When GAME refers to a game with a Satellaview memory pak slot, SUBGAME1 should
be the path to a game folder or ROM file representing the memory pak to insert
into the slot. If SUBGAME1 is not supplied, higan will prompt for one. SUBGAME2
is ignored.
.sp
When GAME refers to the Super Game Boy or Super Game Boy 2, SUBGAME1 should be
the path to a game folder or ROM file representing a Game Boy game to insert
into the slot. If SUBGAME1 is not supplied, higan will prompt for one. SUBGAME2
is ignored.
.sp
When GAME refers to the Sufami Turbo, then SUBGAME1 should be the path to a game
folder or ROM file representing the mini\-cartridge to be inserted into slot A of
the Sufami Turbo base cartridge, and SUBGAME2 is the same thing for slot B.
higan will prompt for any mini\-cartridges not supplied on the command\-line.
.sp
When GAME refers to any other game, both SUBGAME1 and SUBGAME2 are ignored.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Play a previously\-imported copy of Super Mario World in fullscreen (assuming

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
