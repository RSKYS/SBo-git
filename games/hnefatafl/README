Hnefatafl is a Norse board game that has been played in Scandinavia
since at least 400 A.D..

This is an implementation written in C. The game rules are defined with
ruleset files and are therefore somewhat flexible. There is a computer
player and an X interface, but both are optional. Network play is not
supported.
