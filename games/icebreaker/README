icebreaker (jezzball-like game for Linux, with a penguin theme)

So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You
have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland,
where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.

Note: if you're upgrading from icebreaker 1.9.x to 2.x, be aware that
there's no longer a system-wide high score file. Instead, high scores
are saved in each user's home directory. This also means the binary is
no longer installed setgid games.
