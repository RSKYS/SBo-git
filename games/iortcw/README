iortcw (Game engine for Return To Castle Wolfenstein)

iortcw is an updated game engine for Return To Caste Wolfenstein
based on the open source ioquake3 engine.

Some of the features currently implemented are :

  * SDL backend
  * OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound)
  * Full x86_64 support
  * VoIP support, both in-game and external support through Mumble
  * AVI video capture of demos
  * Much improved console autocompletion
  * Persistent console history
  * Colorized terminal output
  * Optional Ogg Vorbis support
  * Much improved QVM tools
  * PNG support

You can enable/disable features by passing variables to the
script (ie. VAR=yes/no ./iortcw.SlackBuild) :

  INSTALL_COMMON_DATA=yes|no (default=yes)
    Enable/disable installation of RTCW 1.41 patch data.

  LANG=no|de|fr|es|it (default=no)
    When INSTALL_COMMON_DATA=yes, define which language-specific
    patches (for single player) must be installed :

      no : do not install any language-specific patches
      de : install german language-specific patches
      fr : install french language-specific patches
      es : install spanish language-specific patches
      it : install italian language-specific patches

  _USE_INTERNAL_LIBS=yes|no (default=no)
   Define whether iortcw must be or not build and linked against
   internal libraries (zlib, jpeg, ogg, opus).

To play Return To Castle Wolfenstein, you need to copy the original
game files (ie *.pk3) from CD/windows install/steamCDM in directory
/usr/share/games/rtcw/main.

Note that, when RTCW 1.41 patch data are included into iortcw
package (see INCLUDE_COMMON_DATA), you only need to copy the
following orignal game files in /usr/share/games/rtcw/main :

  mp_pak0.pk3
  mp_pak1.pk3
  mp_pak2.pk3
  pak0.pk3
  sp_pak1.pk3
  sp_pak2.pk3
