jfsw_hires_pack (graphic enhancements for jfsw)

This adds high resolution textures and 3D models to Shadow Warrior. For
use with slackbuilds.org jfsw package.

*** NOTE:
*** The data file "sw.grp" from the full retail version is *required*
*** to use this package; it will NOT work with the shareware/demo
*** version. If you get a segfault at startup, the game is using the
*** shareware sw.grp.

If you have jfsw_demo_data installed, remove it with removepkg, and copy
sw.grp from the full version to "/usr/share/games/jfsw/sw.grp". If you
do not have the full version of the game, you can't use this package!
