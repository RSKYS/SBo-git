jfsw_twin_dragon (game data for Shadow Warrior expansion pack)

Twin Dragon is an expansion to the Shadow Warrior Classic and was
released as a free download on July 4, 1998. It was created by Wylde
Productions and Level Infinity, and features music by Castles Music
Productions[*]. The game features 13 new levels, new sounds, artwork
and a new final boss, Hung Lo, who replaced Zilla.

After installing the package, "Twin Dragons (Addon)" should appear in
the Game tab of the jfsw launcher. If it doesn't, upgrade jfsw to the
latest build (at least version 20180424_8fc2d54, build 2).

The expansion doesn't change the first episode of the game. To play the
new levels, choose episode 2 ("Code of Honor") when starting a new game.

The original Twin Dragon release included a modified Shadow Warrior
executable, which changed the episode and level names for the expansion.
This build doesn't (currently) do that, so you'll see the original names
(e.g. "Code of Honor", rather than "Twin Dragon").

[*] This build doesn't include any new music. The Twin Dragon release
    zip file doesn't include it.
