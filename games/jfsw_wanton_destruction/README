jfsw_wanton_destruction (game data for Shadow Warrior expansion pack)

Wanton Destruction is an expansion pack for Shadow Warrior, originally
developed in the late 1990s by Sunstorm Interactive. Although it was
never commercially released, in 2005 it was unearthed and released as
a freeware download on the 3D Realms website.

Wanton Destruction is a standalone game, fully playable with jfsw. The
data file (SW.GRP) from the original game is NOT required. Select
"wt.grp" from the Game tab, in the jfsw launcher. The first episode is
identical to the shareware and full versions of Shadow Warrior; select
"Code of Honor" at the "New Game" menu, to play the new content.

From the original documentation (wdinfo.txt):

  Wanton Destruction features twelve of the most eye popping levels
  you will ever trip through! Featuring: Chinatown, Monastery Gardens,
  San Francisco Trolley Yards, Chinese Restaurant, Skyscraper Under
  Construction, on board a 747, high tech Secret Military Base, Japanese
  Bullet Train, Zilla's Auto Factory, and Tokyo Rooftops. In addition,
  the episode contains not one, but two full size super secret levels
  that will have you on the edge of your seat! In addition, we've
  included three all new Wangbang-only levels as well as a capture the
  flag level!
