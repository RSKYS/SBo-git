jg-geolith (Neo Geo emulation core for Jolly Good Emulation)

jg-geolith is a highly accurate emulator for the Neo Geo AES and
MVS. This emulator supports TerraOnion's NEO file format only.

Filenames supported: .neo
To run files with other extensions: jollygood -c geolith <filename>

By default, no controls are mapped. The first time you run a game,
press Shift-1 to configure the first controller.

BIOS files from a recent MAME set are required:
 - aes.zip for Neo Geo AES (Home Console)
 - neogeo.zip for Neo Geo MVS (Arcade) and Unibios
Copy these files to: ~/.local/share/jollygood/bios/
