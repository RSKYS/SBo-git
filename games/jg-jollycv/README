jg-jollycv (ColecoVision emulation core for Jolly Good Emulation)

JollyCV is a highly accurate emulator for the ColecoVision, including
support for the Super Game Module.

JollyCV was the first emulator written specifically for The Jolly
Good API. It is designed to document the ColecoVision for educational
purposes through verbose comments, and high quality emulation. The
ColecoVision is the perfect console to use to demonstrate how computer
systems and emulators function because it is very simple and uses
generic, off-the-shelf chips with widely available datasheets.

Filenames supported: .col .rom
To run files with other extensions: jollygood -c jollycv <filename>

By default, no controls are mapped. The first time you run a game,
press Shift-1 to configure the first controller.

You'll need the ColecoVision BIOS ROM image (coleco.rom),
available on the standard ROM dump sites on the Web, or in the
clksignal-roms build from SlackBuilds.org. Copy coleco.rom to
"~/.local/share/jollygood/bios/coleco.rom". There are several variant
ROM images, all 8192 bytes in size. The most common one has an md5sum
of 2c66f5911e5b42b8ebe113403548eee7.
