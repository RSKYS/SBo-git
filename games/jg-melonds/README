jg-melonds (Nintendo DS/DSi emulation core for Jolly Good Emulation)

melonDS is an emulator for the Nintendo DS and DSi. The Jolly Good API
port is designed for use with content for the Nintendo DS. Source for
the emulator core is unmodified from upstream sources.

Filenames supported: .nds .dsi
To run files with other extensions: jollygood -c melonds <filename>

By default, no controls are mapped. The first time you run a game,
press Shift-1 to configure the first controller.

Note: the touchscreen is emulated with the mouse. Press Shift-2 to
configure it, then click the mouse button you want to use (probably
the left one). Mouse control is easier to use when running fullscreen.

Note: this core doesn't build on 32-bit x86.
