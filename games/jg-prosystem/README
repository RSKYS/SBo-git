jg-prosystem (Atari 7800 emulation core for Jolly Good Emulation)

ProSystem JG is an emulator for the Atari 7800. This is a fork of
ProSystem 1.3e with patches from OpenEmu, which contains patches
derived from Wii7800 and js7800.

Note: Although the Atari 7800 can play Atari 2600 games, this emulator
only supports 7800 games.

Filenames supported: .a78
To run files with other extensions: jollygood -c prosystem <filename>

By default, no controls are mapped. The first time you run a game,
press Shift-1 to configure the first controller. Then press Shift-3
to map the controls on the console (Reset, Select, Pause, Left/Right
Difficulty).
