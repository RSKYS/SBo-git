# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jg-sameboy: Source for the emulator core is unmodified from upstream sources.

jg-sameboy: File will be loaded as the second game (the first game specified on
jg-sameboy: the command line in The Jolly Good Reference Frontend, and displayed
jg-sameboy: on the bottom). Save data will work for both games, but cheats and
jg-sameboy: states only work for the main game. The link cable and IR sensor are
