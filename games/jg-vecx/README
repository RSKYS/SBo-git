jg-vecx (Vectrex emulation core for Jolly Good Emulation)

Vecx JG is an emulator for the Vectrex.

This is a fork of the original, unmodified vecx sources made available
by Valavan Manohararajah at http://www.valavan.net/vectrex.html. Many
new features have been added since the fork was created. The emulator
now contains a new renderer, save states, and support for PSG and DAC
based audio.

Filenames supported: .vec
To run files with other extensions: jollygood -c vecx <filename>

By default, no controls are mapped. The first time you run a game,
press Shift-1 to configure the first controller.
