Jin (Graphical Client for Chess Servers)

Jin is an open source, cross platform, graphical client for chess
servers, written in Java. Jin can run either as a standalone
application or as an applet, directly from your browser. Currently
supported servers are the Internet Chess Club and the Free Internet
Chess Server. Officially supported platforms are Microsoft Windows,
Mac OS X and Linux, although Jin should work on any operating system
with a modern Java Runtime Environment (1.4 or later).
