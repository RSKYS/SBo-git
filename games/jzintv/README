jzintv is an emulator and development environment for the Mattel
Intellivision game console.

The Intellivision console contains code in the form of ROM. jzintv
requires images of these ROMs in order to run. This package does not
contain the ROM images due to copyright concerns. You can use the ROMs
from the commercially available "Intellivision Lives!" CD-ROM, dump the
ROMs from an Intellivision console, or attempt to find the ROMs on the
'net somewhere. These are the same ROMs used by the MESS emulator,
usually found as "intv.zip". Contents:

exec.bin, 8192 bytes, md5sum 62e761035cb657903761800f4437b8af
grom.bin, 2048 bytes, md5sum 0cd5946c6473e42e8e4c2137785e427f

Your md5sums may not match, since Mattel released several versions of
the ROMs. The above are known to work, but other versions might also
work. jzintv looks for the .bin files, not the .zip file.

Once you have the ROM images, place them in the /usr/share/jzintv/rom
directory.
