# Wrapper script to launch koules from a KDE shortcut
# Author: B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com)

# If the GUI launcher can't run (probably because Tcl/Tk isn't
# installed), just start the game with default options.

# This script used to use artsdsp to make the dumb old OSS sound code
# in the game play nice with KDE's sound server. Apparently this is no
# longer necessary in KDE 4 (at least, it seems to work for me without it).
