LARN is a dungeon type adventure game similar in concept to HACK, ROGUE
or MORIA, but with a different feel and winning criteria.  LARN was
released for the UNIX environment in 1986 by Noah Morgan.  It was
subsequently ported to the MS-DOS environment by Don Kneller.  Kevin
Routley worked on enhancements to LARN.
