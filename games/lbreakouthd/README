LBreakoutHD is a breakout-style arcade game in the manner of
Arkanoid. You try to clear levels full of different types of
bricks and extras by using your paddle to aim balls at the
bricks. Lots of power-ups will help you with that task:
extra balls, energy balls, extra lifes, weapons, glue,
bonus floors, paddle expansion and extra score.

LBreakoutHD is a scaleable 16:9 remake of LBreakout2.
All LBreakout2 themes and levelsets work.
New themes can be of any resolution.
