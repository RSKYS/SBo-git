# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lmarbles: lmarbles (2D puzzle game)
lmarbles:
lmarbles: LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in
lmarbles: concept. Instead of assembling molecules you create figures out of
lmarbles: marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble
lmarbles: starts to move it will not stop until it hits a wall or another
lmarbles: marble. To make it more interesting there are obstacles like one-way
lmarbles: streets, crumbling walls and portals.
