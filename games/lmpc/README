lmpc (The Little Movie Processing Centre)

LMPC is a utility to handle: DOOM, DOOM 2, Heretic, Hexen and Strife
LMP files; Duke Nukem 3D and Redneck Rampage DMO files; Quake DEM
QuakeWorld QWD files; and Quake II Arena DM3 files. The DEM file cutter
tool (demcut), The DEM Text File Analyser (dema), the Broadcasting
Server (dbs) and the DM2 file concatenator (dm2cat) are part of this
package too.

Building this requires TeTex or TexLive to be installed, and
/usr/share/texmf/bin to be in your PATH. On a stock install, simply
enter a real root shell ("su -") before building.
