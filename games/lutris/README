Lutris is an open gaming platform for Linux.  It helps you install and
manage your games in a unified interface.  The goal is to support every
game which runs on Linux, from native to Windows games (via Wine) to
emulators and browser games.

allegro and wine are optional dependencies for some of the runners.
