# 20170902 bkw: Updated for v0.189.
# - Fix complay.py build error. Turns out that the build would fail
#   only on systems where PyXML is installed, so add -S to python
#   command line so 'import xml.sax' imports the xml stuff that ships
#   with core python, instead of the (outdated, deprecated) 3rd-party
#   stuff from PyXML.
# - Stop installing useless junk in /usr/doc.
# - Install swlist docs.
# - Compacted log entries.

# 20170726 bkw: Updated for v0.188.
# 20170702 bkw: Updated for v0.187.

# 20170607 bkw: Updated for v0.186.
# - Link with ld.gold instead of the default ld, which saves *2 hours* of
#   build time on my test box (build is 3x as fast as it was).

# 20170428 bkw: Updated for v0.185.

# 20170404 bkw:
# - mame.ini: get rid of $HOME in bgfx_path. Thanks to Doogster for
# reporting this.

# 20170330 bkw: Updated for v0.184.

# 20170301 bkw:
# - Use long-form github URL.
# - Fix changelog so newer entries are at the top.

# 20170223 bkw: Updated for v0.183.
# 20170214 bkw: Add support for GroovyMAME patch.
# 20170128 bkw: Updated for v0.182.
# 20170111 bkw: Updated for v0.181. Missed a month again.
# 20161101 bkw: Updated for v0.179.

# 20160928 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.178. Sorry, missed a month.
# - Install artwork/ and bgfx/ so the new bgfx shader stuff will work.
# - Set bgfx_path in mame.ini. The default is still 'video opengl' but
#   now it's easy to enable bgfx, just by changing to 'video bgfx'.
#   Thanks to Doogster for pointing this out.

# 20160728 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.176. Upstream does a release on the last Wednesday
#   of every month. I doubt I'm going to find time to update this
#   script 12 times a year, but maybe...

# 20160721 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.175 (again, after missing several releases)
# - Update ARCH stuff, i486 => i586
# - Add missing mame.6 and mess.6 man pages (whoops!)
# - man pages now in docs/man/ instead of src/osd/sdl/
# - Don't modify the *.1 man pages to put them in section 6 any more
# - Symlink mame -> mess in /usr/games (to keep old frontends working)
# - Disable QT debugger by default, as it now requires qt5 and I don't
#   want qt5 as a hard dep for this... how many people who install mame
#   are *really* going to debug the game ROM code?
# - Add QTDEBUG=yes option for people who really want the debugger,
#   make slack-desc say whether or not it's enabled.
# - Upstream removed 'testkeys', stop trying to install it.

# 20151112 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.167, after missing several releases (sorry!)
# - Get rid of MESS and UME options, mame has basically turned
#   into UME at this point (includes old mame + mess in one binary)
# - Use shipped man pages from the source, instead of our own
# - Add new tools: castool floptool imgtool nlwav
# - Use icon extracted from mame.ico in the source
# - Update .ini file slightly (sound=sdl, not sound=1)
