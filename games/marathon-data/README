marathon-data (game data for use with alephone package)

Marathon is a fight for survival against the Pfhor, an alien race
attacking your colony ship. This fan-made conversion known as M1A1
brings the start of the Marathon trilogy to Aleph One.

Included in the package is a shell script wrapper. Type "marathon"
or select Marathon from the KDE or XFCE "Games" menu.
