# 20201026 bkw: if someone started the game without the wrapper
# script (giving the path to the gamedata on the command line),
# then tries to start the game again using this wrapper script,
# it would fail to find its data files. Added ALEPHONE_DEFAULT_DATA
# here to work around it. The issue was pointed out to me by
# orbea, and lives here:
# https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/issues/24#issuecomment-715476894

ALEPHONE_DATA="/usr/share/AlephOne/gamedata/Marathon"
ALEPHONE_DEFAULT_DATA="$ALEPHONE_DATA"
export ALEPHONE_DATA ALEPHONE_DEFAULT_DATA

# work around another issue found by orbea:
# https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/pull/225
# I can't reproduce this, it may only affect -current, but I can't see
# any harm in adding the workaround here.
