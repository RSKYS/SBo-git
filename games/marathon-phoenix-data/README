marathon-phoenix (game data for use with alephone)

Marathon Phoenix is a 35-level single player major conversion.

This scenario is difficult and action-packed; it features a full
arsenal of new, powerful weapons, and more threatening enemies than you
could ever want.

1.3 now has stats support for Lhowon.org's solo/coop leaderboards, and
a few bonus levels from an unfinished project appended to the end of the
campaign.

Included in the package is a shell script wrapper. Type
"marathon-phoenix" or select Marathon Phoenix from the KDE or XFCE
"Games" menu.

To install the gamedata in /opt instead of /usr to save space in the
root partition use use:

  OPT=yes ./marathon-phoenix-data.SlackBuild
