mari0 (platform game)

A complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus on
perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. Then give Mario a
portal gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there you go. And
if that wasn't crazy enough, play 4-player coop, with everyone having
their own Portal gun!

First time players: the default movement keys are WASD, not the arrows.
Aim and fire the portal gun with the mouse.
