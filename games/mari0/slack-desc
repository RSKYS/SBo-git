# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mari0:
mari0: A complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus
mari0: on perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. Then give
mari0: Mario a portal gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there
mari0: you go. And if that wasn't crazy enough, play 4-player coop, with
mari0: everyone having their own Portal gun!
