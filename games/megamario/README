megamario (Super Mario Brothers clone)

Mega Mario is a Super Mario Brothers 1 clone. It features everything the
original features - with better graphics, higher resolution, smoother
movement and new levels. The story of Mario and Luigi continues in
old-school style.

If you want to change the window size or use fullscreen, edit
~/.megamario/mario.ini after running & exiting the game.

The megamario level editor is Windows-only, so it's not included in
this build.
