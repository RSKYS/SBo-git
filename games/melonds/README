melonDS aims at providing fast and accurate Nintendo DS emulation.
While it is still a work in progress, it has a pretty solid set of
features:

  * Nearly complete core (CPU, video, audio, ...)
  * JIT recompiler for fast emulation
  * OpenGL renderer, 3D upscaling
  * RTC, microphone, lid close/open
  * Joystick support
  * Savestates
  * Various display position/sizing/rotation modes
  * (WIP) Wifi: local multiplayer, online connectivity
  * (WIP) DSi emulation
  * DLDI
  * (WIP) GBA slot add-ons
  * and more are planned!

melonds will build against qt5 by default, if you would prefer to
build against qt6, please pass QT6=ON to the build script. This
will introduce a dependency on qt6.
