Mesen-X is a fork of Mesen, which is a cross-platform NES/Famicom
emulator for Windows & Linux built in C++ and C#. The original Mesen
project has paused development, and this fork is meant to collect
patches contributed by the community.

Changes include:
  * Support for newer versions of Mono, for running Mesen on Linux
  * ESPM homebrew expansion audio support
  * HD Pack improvements
  * Replaced VRC7 synth code with Nuked-OPLL
  * Debugger improvements, for Alchemy65

If you would like to build the libretro core, pass LIBRETRO=yes to
the SlackBuild script.
