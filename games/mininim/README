mininim (Prince of Persia rewrite)

MININIM is the Advanced Prince of Persia Engine - a childhood dream,
the free software implementation of Jordan Mechner's masterpiece game,
developed from scratch by Bruno Felix Rezende Ribeiro (oitofelix). In
addition to being already a complete replacement for the original game
with several improvements, MININIM aims to have detailed documentation
on all matters concerning the original Prince of Persia world, ranging
from its design concepts to the engine's practical use and development.

The docs are installed in "/usr/doc/mininim-$VERSION/mininim.html/",
as separate HTML pages. If you plan to print the documentation,
set PDF=yes in the script's environment, and print the file
"/usr/doc/mininim-$VERSION/mininim.pdf". This uses an extra 870K of
disk space.
