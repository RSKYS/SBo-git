miscom (textmode Missile Command clone)

In miscom you must defend cities from missile attack. You do this
by launching missiles of your own (in a point-and-blast fashion) to
destroy the enemy missiles before they land.

Miscom is a curses-based game, so it should work on any
terminal. (You'll need 9600 baud or better for it to be playable.) It
supports colour and sound.

Miscom is an older game that uses OSS for audio. By default, this
script links with libaoss, which allows the game to make sound without
having OSS modules loaded. If you for some reason want to disable this
(e.g. if you run OSSv4 for audio), export AOSS=no in the script's
environment.
