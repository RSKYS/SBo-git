Mupen64Plus is a cross-platform plugin-based N64 emulator which is
capable of accurately playing many games. Included are four MIPS R4300
CPU emulators, with dynamic recompilers for 32-bit x86 and 64-bit amd64
systems, and necessary plugins for audio, graphical rendering (RDP),
signal co-processor (RSP), and input. There is 1 included OpenGL video
plugin, called RiceVideo.

Mupen64plus does not come with a GUI.  For a GUI, install the m64py
or RMG package available here at SBo.

This is the nightly build which is under active development and changes
rapidly. For the stable build pleas see mupen64plus.

This package conflicts with mupen64plus, only install one or the other.
