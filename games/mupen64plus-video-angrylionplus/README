This is a conservative fork of angrylion's RDP plugin that aims to
improve performance and add new features while retaining the accuracy
of the original plugin.

Current features:
  * More maintainable code base by dividing the huge n64video.cpp into
    smaller pieces.
  * Improved portability by separating the emulator plugin interface
    and window management from the RDP emulation core.
  * Improved performance on multi-core CPUs by using multi-threaded
    rendering with scan line interleaving.
  * Replaced deprecated DirectDraw interface with a modern OpenGL 3.3
    implementation.
  * Added fullscreen support and manual window sizing.
  * Added BMP screenshot support.
  * Added settings GUI.
  * Added Mupen64Plus support.
