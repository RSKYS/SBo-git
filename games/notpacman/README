notpacman (rotating pac-man game)

Ever wondered what Pacman would be like with physics? No? Well, it's
revolutionary. This mashup of "Not" and "Pacman" puts The Pac and the
Ghosts in a Pacworld cage, at the mercy of gravity and the level's
shape, controlled solely by you. Ghosts still don't like you very much,
so you should be careful to make Pacman avoid them.
