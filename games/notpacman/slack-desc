# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

notpacman: Ever wondered what Pacman would be like with physics? No? Well,
notpacman: it's revolutionary. This mashup of "Not" and "Pacman" puts The Pac
notpacman: and the Ghosts in a Pacworld cage, at the mercy of gravity and the
notpacman: level's shape, controlled solely by you. Ghosts still don't like
notpacman: you very much, so you should be careful to make Pacman avoid them.
