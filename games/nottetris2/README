nottetris2 (tetris clone with physics)

Not Tetris 2 is the spiritual successor of the classic Tetris mixed
with physics. The result is a fun spinoff in which blocks are no
longer bound to the usual grid. Blocks can be rotated and placed at any
angle, resulting in a complete mess if not careful. And with the newest
cutting edge technology, Not tetris 2 allows line clears when the lines
are sufficiently filled. The old mode is still available for play and
is now called Stack.

Also in this version is a multiplayer mode that allows up to 2 players
on a single computer, with each having their own seperate Stack to
fill. In the Invade mode, players can bounce their blocks to their
opponent's side and save up on their own space.
