# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nottetris2: nottetris2 (tetris clone with physics)
nottetris2:
nottetris2: Not Tetris 2 is the spiritual successor of the classic Tetris mixed
nottetris2: with physics. The result is a fun spinoff in which blocks are no
nottetris2: longer bound to the usual grid. Blocks can be rotated and placed at
nottetris2: any angle, resulting in a complete mess if not careful. And with the
nottetris2: newest cutting edge technology, Not tetris 2 allows line clears when
nottetris2: the lines are sufficiently filled. The old mode is still available
nottetris2: for play and is now called Stack.
