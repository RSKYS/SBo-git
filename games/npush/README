nPush is a logic game similar to Sokoban and Boulder Dash.
You need to collect all the gold on the level and reach the exit.
To make it hard there are some rocks that stand in your way, and
you also have some dynamite to blast them away. Main difference
from Sokoban, KSokoban and similar games is that you can have
multiple player-controlled characters you can move on the screen.
