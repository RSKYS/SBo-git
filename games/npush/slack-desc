# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

npush: npush (logic game)
npush:
npush: nPush is a logic game similar to Sokoban and Boulder Dash.
npush: You need to collect all the gold on the level and reach the exit.
npush: To make it hard there are some rocks that stand in your way, and
npush: you also have some dynamite to blast them away. Main difference from
npush: Sokoban, KSokoban and similar games is that you can have multiple
npush: player-controlled characters you can move on the screen.
