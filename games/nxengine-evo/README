A somewhat upgraded/refactored version of NXEngine by Caitlin Shaw.

NXEngine is a complete open-source clone/rewrite of the masterpiece
jump-and-run platformer Doukutsu Monogatari (also known as Cave Story).

Differences from the original version of NXEngine:
  * Port to SDL2 (thanks to PIlin)
  * More resolutions and proper widescreen support up to Full HD
    (thanks to EXL)
  * Animated character portraits
  * Modern main menu
  * Credits graphics specific to the Mimiga Mask ending
  * Localization support
  * Force feedback support
  * Custom soundtrack support
  * Initial mod support
  * Vita/Switch versions
  * Cleaner and partly-refactored code
  * Tons of gameplay-related bugfixes
  * Removed built-in data extractor
  * Removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway
