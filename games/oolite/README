Oolite is inspired by the 8-bit classic Elite, and many aspects of
gameplay will be familiar to players of that game. In the tradition
of open-world games, there's no overall story: you can be a
millionaire trader, a veteran combateer, a feared pirate, a lonely
miner, a notorious smuggler, or all of them, or something else
entirely, based on your own actions.
