# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

oolite:
oolite: Oolite is inspired by the 8-bit classic Elite, and many aspects of
oolite: gameplay will be familiar to players of that game. In the tradition
oolite: of open-world games, there's no overall story: you can be a
oolite: millionaire trader, a veteran combateer, a feared pirate, a lonely
oolite: miner, a notorious smuggler, or all of them, or something else
oolite: entirely, based on your own actions.
