advent (Colossal Cave Adventure, the 1995 430-point version)

This is the last descendent of the original 1976 Colossal Cave
Adventure worked on by the original authors - Crowther & Woods. It
has sometimes been known as Adventure 2.5. The original PDP-10 name
'advent' is used to avoid collision with the bsd-games version.

This code is a forward-port of the Crowther/Woods Adventure 2.5
from 1995, last version in the main line of Colossal Cave Adventure
development written by the original authors. The authors have given
permission and encouragement for this release. The file history.txt
contains a more detailed history of this game and its ancestors.
