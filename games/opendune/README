opendune (realtime strategy game)

OpenDUNE is an open source re-creation of the popular game "Dune
II", originally made by Westwood Studios, and released by Virgin
Entertainment. It attempts to re-create the original game and apply
modern technology to it to allow it to be run natively on most
operating systems.

To play the game, you'll need the *.PAK files from the original game.
All three existing versions of the Dune 2 1.07 data files (eu, hs
and us) will work, but the French language will only work with the
eu/hs data files, and the German language will only work with the eu
data files. Copy or symlink the .PAK files from the original game to
"/usr/share/games/opendune/data". The filenames can be uppercase or
lowercase.

If you're building a package for a very old x86 system (that doesn't
support MMX), on a newer system (that does support MMX), set MMX=no in
the script's environment. If you're building on the same system you'll
install the package on, you don't have to worry about this (MMX will
be autodetected).

Optional dependencies:

If SDL2 and SDL2_image are installed, opendune will use them rather than
SDL 1. To avoid this (to always build with SDL 1), set SDL2=no in the
script's environment.

To hear the in-game music, install TiMidity++ and eawpats.
