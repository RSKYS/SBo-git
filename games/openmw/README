OpenMW is a new and modern engine based on the one that runs the 2002
open-world RPG Morrowind. The engine (OpenMW) will come with its own
editor (OpenCS) which will allow the user to edit or create their own
games. Both OpenCS and OpenMW are written from scratch and aren't made
to support any third party programs the original Morrowind engine uses
to improve its functionality.
