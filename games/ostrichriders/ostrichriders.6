.SH SYNOPSIS

ostrichriders [\fI\-l libdir\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enemy knights are invading the kingdom. As one of the elite ostrich
riders, it is your duty to defend the kingdom. With lance in hand
you fly off. Remember to stay above your opponent lest you fall to
his lance. Collect the eggs lest your opponent hatches stronger than
before. Work together with other knights.
.sp
The game is controlled entirely via the keyboard. Up to 3 players can
