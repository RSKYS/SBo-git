PCGen helps you build characters for role-playing games like
[Pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG) and
[D&D](http://dnd.wizards.com).

It's like a character sheet that handles all the tricky and tedious
parts of building characters. You can use it to build one character
for yourself, or to keep track of a dozen NPCs for a game world.

PCGen is a volunteer project, so it's free of charge and always will
be.
