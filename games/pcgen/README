PCGen helps you build characters for role-playing games like D&D
(http://dnd.wizards.com) and Pathfinder (http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG)

It's a digital character sheet that handles all the tricky and tedious
parts of building characters. You can use it to build one character
for yourself, or to keep track of a dozen NPCs for a game world.

This build is a binary repack, so it's available for x86_64 only.
