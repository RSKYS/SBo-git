PCSX ReARMed is yet another PCSX fork based on the PCSX-Reloaded
project, which itself contains code from PCSX, PCSX-df and
PCSX-Revolution. This version is ARM architecture oriented and features
MIPS->ARM recompiler by Ari64, NEON GTE code and more performance
improvements. It was created for Pandora handheld, but should be
usable on other devices after some code adjustments (N900,
GPH Wiz/Caanoo, PlayBook versions are also available).

PCSX ReARMed features ARM NEON GPU by Exophase, that in many cases 
produces pixel perfect graphics at very high performance. There is
also Una-i's GPU plugin from PCSX4ALL project, and traditional
P.E.Op.S. one.

PCSX ReARMed looks for the following BIOS image files inside the
frontend's 'System Directory'.

* scph5500.bin (MD5 sum: 8dd7d5296a650fac7319bce665a6a53c)
* scph5501.bin (MD5 sum: 490f666e1afb15b7362b406ed1cea246)
* scph5502.bin (MD5 sum: 32736f17079d0b2b7024407c39bd3050)

In case it can find no BIOS files named like this inside the 'System
Directory', it will default to a High-Level Emulation BIOS.
This decreases the level of compatibility of the emulator, so it is
recommended that you always supply valid BIOS images inside the system
directory.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./pcsx-rearmed.SlackBuild
