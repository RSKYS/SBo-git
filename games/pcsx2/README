PCSX2 is an open source Playstation 2 emulator. Its purpose is to
mimic the PS2 hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU Interpreters,
Recompilers and a Virtual Machine which manages hardware states and PS2
system memory.

portaudio is an optional dependency.

NOTE: This is buildable only on x86 32bit platforms and will require
a PS2 bios dump to play games. For x86_64 64bit platforms multilib
support will be needed including compat32 versions of SDL2, wxGTK3,
soundtouch and optionally portaudio.

PCSX2 offers experimental support for the EGL api instead of GLX. This
can be used by building PCSX2 with:
  EGL_API=yes ./pcsx2.SlackBuild

To build debugging symbols for PCSX2 use:
  DEBUG=yes ./pcsx2.SlackBuild

Alternatively a devel build can be used:
  DEVEL=yes ./pcsx2.SlackBuild

If a debug or devel build is used, asan support can also be built:
  ASAN=yes ./pcsx2.SlackBuild

The following environment variable will be required to use asan:
  ASAN_OPTIONS=allow_user_segv_handler=1:abort_on_error=1
