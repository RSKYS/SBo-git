penguin-command (Missile Command clone)

This is a clone of the classic "Missile Command" Game, but it has
better graphics and music. The gameplay has only been slightly
modified. Penguin Command is licensed under the GPL.

By default, the game runs fullscreen unless you pass it the -w
option. If you want to patch the code so the game starts in a window by
default, set WINDOWED=yes in the SlackBuild script's environment. This
only changes the default, it will still be possible to use the -f
option to get fullscreen mode, or press Alt-Enter to toggle fullscreen
mode.
