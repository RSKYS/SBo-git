PlayOnLinux is a graphical front-end for Wine which automatically
creates a prefix for the application you're trying to install. It
manages its own wine versions internally, meaning you only have to
have some version of Wine already already installed as a base and
PlayOnLinux will automatically download and use whatever Wine version
is necessary (which can also be specified by the user in the case of
manual, unscripted installations). POL supports the use of installation
scripts which are used to automatically install an application and
configure Wine to work with that application. Dozens of official
scripts for various games and software already exist, and the POL
website has tutorials to instruct users on writing their own.

For maximum performance and compatibility, PlayOnLinux should be run on
a 32-bit system, or on a 64-bit system enabled for multilib, and 32-bit
graphic libraries should be available.
