QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager. It can connect PS3 hardware
(Sixaxis/DualShock3 and Keypads) to a Linux-compatible machine.
Currently it supports Sixaxis buttons, axis, accelerometers and LEDs.

Some patches thankfully taken from:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qtsixa/.

Notes:

Be sure you are using a Bluetooth dongle with a HCI version higher
than 1.1 by using `hciconfig default version | grep HCI`.

Please note that due to the behaviour of "sixpair" and a replaced
"hidd", the stock Bluetooth stack is getting disabled while running
and no other Bluetooth devices will work, until the "replaced" hidd is
disabled again from `sh /etc/rc.d/rc.sixad stop`.

In case something like `kdesu` is not installed, you need to run
`qtsixa` with root rights.

Steps:

- connect your device through USB
- start "qtsixa" and pair your device (Tasks->Pair Device to PC)
- start "sixad" by `sh /etc/rc.d/rc.sixad start`
- press the PS button on your controller

Pairing is just needed once. If wanted, you can add rc.sixad to your
rc.local and pressing the PS button again after a reboot without any
further interaction.
