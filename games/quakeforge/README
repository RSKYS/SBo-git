QuakeForge is a source port of id Software's Quake I.

You will need at least pak0.pak to play the shareware version,
and pak1.pak to play the full game. These can be added to either
~/.quakeforge/id1 or /usr/share/games/quakeforge/id1/.

Note: You may have to manually specify the resolution for OpenGL clients
e.g. nq-glx -width 1024 -height 768 -fullscreen
