Quarry is a universal board game interface program. At present it
supports three games: Go, Amazons and Reversi. It is intended to be
useful for both users and developers of game engines (i.e. programs
that play board games).

Quarry uses are currently limited to playing against a computer
program (e.g. GNU Go) and browsing and editing SGF game records.
