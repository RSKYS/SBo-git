Make a grid in any shape and size from mini to jumbo, rectangular,
hex or circular, on a Moebius strip or on a torus... and much more.
Use bars or blocks - or even a mixture of both.
Dozens of types of symmetry including simple rotational symmetry and
mirror symmetries as well as 'left-and-right' and 'up-and-down'.
Interactive or fully automatic filling of whole or partial grid - and
lots, lots more.

NOTE:  If you wish to include the qxw-guide.[version].pdf in the
package, download from http://www.quinapalus.com/qxw.html and add the
file to your Qxw SlackBuild directory (where this file is).  It will
automatically be added to the SBo package.

This Slackbuild is suitable for Slackware 14.0 and upwards.

This updated version is a maintenance release.

** Ignore the
'/bin/sh: dpkg-buildflags: command not found'
warnings, it will build fine on Slackware**
