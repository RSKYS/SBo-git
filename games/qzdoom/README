qzdoom (software-rendered engine for Doom and related games)

QZDoom is a continuation of dpJudas's truecolor software rendering,
for ZDoom, merged with and forked from GZDoom. It supports Doom,
Doom II, Heretic, Hexen, Strife, and most other IWAD games.

See README_SBo.txt for optional runtime dependencies.

Starting with qzdoom-2.1.0 BUILD=2, it's now safe to install gzdoom
and qzdoom on the same Slackware system.
