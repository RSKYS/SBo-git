Red Eclipse (Fast-paced futuristic FPS)

Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person
ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends
itself toward a balanced gameplay, completely at the control of map
makers, while maintaining a general theme of agility in a variety of
environments.

This package is a re-build rather than a re-packaging of the
Red Eclipse release, respecting your custom SLKCFLAGS.
