# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

redeclipse: redeclipse (Fast-paced futuristic FPS)
redeclipse:
redeclipse: Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person
redeclipse: ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends
redeclipse: itself toward a balanced gameplay, completely at the control of map
redeclipse: makers, while maintaining a general theme of agility in a variety of
redeclipse: environments.
redeclipse: This package is a re-build rather than a re-packaging of the
redeclipse: Red Eclipse release, respecting your custom SLKCFLAGS.
