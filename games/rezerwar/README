Rezerwar is a puzzle game that could be quickly described as
the illegitimate child of a known tetromino game and a pipe game.
I adopted this bastard child and tried to give it some life.  The goal
of this game is to basically create networks of water and make them
disappear, a couple tricks and techniques will help you achieve this
goal faster.
