rigel-engine (Duke Nukem II reimplementation)

RigelEngine is a reimplementation of the game Duke Nukem II,
originally released by Apogee Software in 1993 for MS-DOS. RigelEngine
works as a drop-in replacement for the original executable: It reads
the game's data files and plays just like the original, but runs
natively on modern operating systems and is written in modern C++
code.

If you're looking for the shareware data files, they're available here:

Compared to running the original in an emulator, RigelEngine offers
many modern enhancements and usability improvements.

The executable and man page are called "RigelEngine".
