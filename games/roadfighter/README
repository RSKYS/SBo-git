In 2003 the people from Retro Remakes organized a remake competition 
for the first time. The idea was to create a remake from scratch in a 
short amount of time. We decided to participate with a remake of the 
MSX game Road Fighter: a simple racing game that would be doable 
before the deadline and still be fun to play (oh the nostalgia!).
