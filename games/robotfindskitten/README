robotfindskitten is a Zen simulation. In this simulation, you play the
part of robot. Your task is to complete the simulation by finding
kitten, as is your destiny, and indeed your wont. You (robot) are
represented by the # character, and you move around with the arrow keys
(Nethack, EMACS, or otherwise) touching things. If the thing you touch
is kitten, you get a cute little animation version, and the simulation 
ends. Otherwise, you get a brief description of what it is you touched. 

robotfindskitten will not compile properly without ncurses, which is
part of a standard Slackware installation.
