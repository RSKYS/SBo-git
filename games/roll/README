roll is a program to roll dices specified in a simple and intuitive way.

Rolls a user-defined dice sequence. The dices to roll are defined using
dN where N is the number of sides. Dices can be rolled multiple times by
prepending the number of repetitions (e.g., 3d6) and used in simple
mathematical expressions (e.g., 2d8+4).
