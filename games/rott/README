rott (Rise of the Triad, first person shooter game)

Rise of the Triad is a high quality, fast scrolling first-person
perspective 3D action game. It includes a lot of destructive enemies,
an arsenal of weapons from simple pistols to missile launchers,
life-preserving armor, traps and ambushes galore.

WARNING: Rise of the Triad features wanton and gratuitous violence.

In order to play the game, you need the data files from
either the retail or shareware (demo) version of the game. See
README_gamedata.txt for details. If you want to include the
shareware game data in your Slackware package, download the file
http://icculus.org/rott/share/1rott13.zip and place it in the directory
with the SlackBuild script, before running the script.

Multiplayer games (aka comm-bat) are NOT truly supported: you can
start up a comm-bat game, but you can only play by yourself (no actual
networking code exists in this version of the game).
