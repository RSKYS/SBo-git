# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sauerbraten: sauerbraten (FPS game based on the original Cube FPS)
sauerbraten:
sauerbraten: Sauerbraten is a free multiplayer/singleplayer first person shooter,
sauerbraten: built as a major redesign of the Cube FPS. Much like the original
sauerbraten: Cube, the aim of this game is not necessarily to produce the most
sauerbraten: features & eyecandy possible, but rather to allow map/geometry
sauerbraten: editing to be done dynamically in-game, to create fun gameplay and
sauerbraten: an elegant engine.
