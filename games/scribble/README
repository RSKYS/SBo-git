Scribble is a hybrid of crossword mentality, positional strategy, and
a true test of your language mastery, similar to the game Scrabble
by Hasbro. You start with a board that serves for the placement for
letter tiles. On the board there are specific squares that when used
can add to your score dramatically. These premium squares can double
or triple letter values. Some of these squares can even double or
triple your word scores! You must position yourself to grab the
squares and block your opponent from spelling out a "killer" word.
