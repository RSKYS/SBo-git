Smokin' Guns (SG) is a first-person shooter video game.
Smokin' Guns is intended to be a semi-realistic simulation of the
American Old West's atmosphere and was developed on id Software's
Quake III Arena Engine. Gameplay as well as locations are inspired
by Western movies, particularly those from the Spaghetti western
genre.

Smokin' Guns' codebase is free and open source software, distributed
under the terms of the GPL; it is built upon ioquake3, an upgrade of
the original Quake III engine. The artwork and other media are
licensed under a proprietary non free license.
