=head1 FILES

ROM image files may be in raw dump format, or may have a header
(details are system-specific). Also, ROM images may be zipped (not
gzipped), in which case the first file in the zip file's directory must
be the ROM image (any other files are ignored).

B<sms_sdl> looks at the filename to determine the type of ROM image
in use. Any file whose name ends in I<.gg> (case-insensitive match) is
considered to be a Game Gear ROM. Any other file is treated as a Sega
Master System ROM. In the case of a zipped image, this refers to the
file inside the zip file; the zip file itself doesn't have any special
naming requirements.

Screenshot filenames (F1 key) are generated by replacing the filename
extension with I<-NNN.bmp>, where NNN is a 3-digit number (000 for the
first screenshot, 001 for the second, etc). The numbering starts at 000
every time the emulator is started, and existing files will be overwritten
without confirmation.

State save filenames (F2 key) are generated by replacing the filename
extension with I<.stN>, where N is the number of the save slot (one or
more digits). Again, existing files are overwritten without confirmation.

Screenshots and savestates are stored in I<~/.sms_sdl>.

=head1 CONFIG FILE

B<sms_sdl> is launched by a shell script wrapper which reads the file
I<~/.sms_sdl/config> if it exists. Any of the options above may be placed
in this file (one option per line, with or without the leading B<-->
characters). These options will be passed as command-line arguments to
the real B<sms_sdl> binary every time it runs.

See B</usr/doc/sms_sdl-VERSION/sample_config> for further information.
