# 20220622 bkw, BUILD=2:
# - strip binary (whoops).
# - remove mention of retroarch support from README, it FTBFS.
#   sooner or later I'll fix it or remove it entirely.
# Note: I tried snes9x 1.61 on Slackware 15.0 with all updates, and
# it still crashes as described below. Also tried latest post-1.61 git
# and it has the same problem. So staying with 1.59 for now, sorry.

# 20211014 bkw: *downgrade* to 1.59, for now at least. 1.60 crashes
# immediately if built with gtk+2 and started with a ROM filename.
# If you pick a ROM from within the app, it'll work sometimes, but
# sometimes it'll crash. When build with gtk+3, it crashes any time
# you try to open the Preferences dialog while a ROM is loaded. I
# also tried the latest git, it acts the same as 1.60 (except that it
# can't be built with gtk+2 any more). I can't get 1.59 to crash, so
# that's what I'm packaging. I don't know if the issues with 1.60 are
# something to do with -current (something that might be fixed before
# 15.0 releases) or something broken upstream. If you're reading this
# after Slackware 15.0 has been released, please remind me to look
# into it again.

# 20191126 bkw: update for 1.60. Upstream has switched from autotools
# to meson for the build system, so this script can no longer build
# old versions.

# 20181201 bkw:
# - update for 1.57.
# - disable OSS audio by default, add OSS=yes option.
# - autodetect RetroArch, add RETROARCH=yes|no option.
# - document the above in the README.
# - document PULSE=no in README.
# - stop including snes9x.conf.default in the docdir, since it's
#   outdated and will cause snes9x to segfault if you try to use it!
# - since we now have 3 build options, make slack-desc show them.
# - add patch from upstream to speed up linking the libretro core if
#   -jX is in MAKEFLAGS.
# - add patch fro upstream to stop segfaulting if the config file is
#   missing the ScanlineIntensity variable. Means I can finaly remove
#   the "you should delete your old config file" from the README.

# 20180730 bkw:
# - BUILD=2.
# - add libretro/RetroArch, thanks to orbea.
# - add --without-portaudio to configure args. snes9x runs about
#   1 frame/sec if I start it up with the sound driver set to portaudio,
#   and I've gotten a report of it blasting high-volume white noise
#   thru the speakers if you switch to portaudio while a ROM is already
#   running. I can't see any reason to use it in favor of pulse, alsa,
#   oss, or sdl audio.
# - don't extract windows, mac, old-school unix stuff from tarball.
#   uses 50% less $TMP space.

# 20180623 bkw: update for 1.56.2.
# 20180611 bkw:
# - update for 1.56.1.
# - switch the UI from gtk3 to gtk2, as 14.2's gtk3 is too old.
# - add undocumented PULSE=no build option (in anticipation of 15.0's
#   pure-alsa-system).
# - add SDL2 to REQUIRES. technically, it's not truly required: snes9x
#   only uses SDL2 to support joysticks. playing with the keyboard/mouse
#   would still work without it. 15.0 is coming soon, and will have SDL2
#   in the core OS, so don't bother me about this decision.
# - update README, the snes9x_gtk build went away in 2010, no need to
#   mention it now. also add notes about upgrading from 1.55.
# 20171221 bkw: use --without-system-zip to build bundled unzip, instead
#               of adding minizip as a dependency.
# 20171213 bkw: update for 1.55.
# 20170302 bkw: use long-format github URL
# 20161015 bkw: update for 1.54.1. script has changed enough that it
# can't build 1.53 any more.
