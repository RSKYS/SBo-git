snes9x (Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator)

Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES
and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation. The
games include some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

When you first run snes9x:

- The first thing you'll want to do is configure the controls. By default
  there are *no* controls set up; you'll be unable to play any games! The
  config is under Options -> Preferences, in the Joypads tab. You can
  configure either keyboard or joystick/gamepad controls, but not both.

- If the game audio is choppy or distorted, try setting the sound driver
  to Pulse or ALSA (Options -> Preferences -> Sound tab). Specifically,
  avoid SDL audio (unfortunately it's the default if PULSE=no).

Notes:

- The package can optionally include the snes9x libretro core, for use
  with RetroArch. By default, the core will be built if RetroArch is
  installed. You can set RETROARCH=yes to force the core to be built,
  or RETROARCH=no to forcibly disable the core. Note that RetroArch
  doesn't have to be installed to build the libretro core, but it's
  useless without RetroArch installed.

- Starting with 1.56.1, you might notice some user interface
  differences. This is because 1.55 used GTK+-3.0, but 1.56 and newer
  require a version of GTK+-3.0 that's newer than Slackware 14.2
  provides. So, starting with 1.56, this build uses the GTK+-2.0 UI.

- Starting with 1.57, OSS audio is disabled by default. Most users
  won't be affected, since pulseaudio is now the default audio system on
  Slackware, and ALSA is the fallback option. If you *need* OSS support,
  set OSS=yes in the script's environment. You may also disable PulseAudio
  by setting PULSE=no in the environment.
