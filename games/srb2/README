srb2 (Sonic Robo Blast 2 game)

Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a 3D open-source Sonic the Hedgehog fangame
built using a modified version of the Doom Legacy port of Doom. SRB2 is
closely inspired by the original Sonic games from the Sega Genesis, and
attempts to recreate the design in 3D. While SRB2 isn't fully completed,
it already features tons of levels, enemies, speed, and quite a lot of
the fun that the original Sonic games provided.

libgme is an optional dependency for srb2. It will be autodetected if
installed. I'm not 100% sure what libgme does for srb2: it's a "game
music emulation" library, but the game music doesn't sound different to
me when srb2 is built with libgme, and I don't see any config settings
to enable it. I haven't played the entire game yet though...

Note for users upgrading from version 2.1.x to 2.2.x: I had to
delete my old config (rm -rf ~/.srb2) to get the game to run without
segfaulting.
