# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

srb2:
srb2: Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a 3D open-source Sonic the Hedgehog fangame
srb2: built using a modified version of the Doom Legacy port of Doom. SRB2
srb2: is closely inspired by the original Sonic games from the Sega Genesis,
srb2: and attempts to recreate the design in 3D. While SRB2 isn't fully
srb2: completed, it already features tons of levels, enemies, speed,
srb2: and quite a lot of the fun that the original Sonic games provided.
