Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up game.  In the
game, you take on the role of a rebel pilot named Chris who is
attempting to overthrow a military corporation called Weapco.  Weapco
has seized control of the known universe and currently rules it with
an iron fist.  Chris can no longer stand back and watch as millions of
people suffer and die.  He steals an experimental craft known as
"Firefly" and begins his mission to fight his way to Sol, freeing key
systems along the way.  The game opens with Chris attempting to escape
a Weapco patrol that has intercepted him.

Note: On slackware 14.2 make sure SDL2_image is 2.0.1 build 2 or higher.
