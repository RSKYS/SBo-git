Steem is a Freeware Atari STE emulator for Windows and Linux. It runs
almost every ST program ever made without any problems. Steem is designed
to be easy to use and has many unique features. Whether you want to run
great old games, use MIDI apps just like you did on the ST or you have
some other, more sinister motive, Steem is the emulator for you!

*** Note to first-time users: Press the Pause/Break key to release the

Steem is binary-only software, no source available. Package includes
the emulator binary and UK TOS images. Optionally, you may include the
US TOS images. To do this, grab them from here:

http://steem.atari.st/tos_us.zip (md5sum: bf250988783a0d468711a1057215fd73)

Place the file "tos_us.zip" in the SlackBuild's directory before building.

The file steem.pdf (installed in the doc dir) was converted from the
CHM version of the steem manual, by Jacek Bogucki.
