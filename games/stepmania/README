StepMania is a free dance and rhythm game for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
It features 3D graphics, keyboard and "dance pad" support, and an
editor for creating your own steps.

StepMania may be optionally built with jack support. To enable, pass
JACK=ON to the script. This introduces a dependency on jack.
