stratagus (RTS game engine)

Stratagus Core is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming
engine. It includes support for playing over the internet/LAN, or
playing a computer opponent. The engine is configurable and can be
used to create games with a wide range of features specific to your
needs.

If you're installing stratagus as a dependency for wargus, make sure
the stratagus and wargus version numbers match. This shouldn't be a
problem (both will be updated at SBo at the same time, when needed).

Stratagus was formerly known as FreeCraft and ALE Clone.

Upgrade note: Why haven't I updated this in 6 years? It's because
newer versions of wargus and stratagus are unable to play the game
using the data files from the Warcraft II CD that I bought in the
1990s. I assume I'm not the only one using the old version of the
game, either.
