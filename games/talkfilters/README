The GNU Talk Filters are filter programs that convert ordinary
English text into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise
humorous dialect. The filters include austro, b1ff, brooklyn,
chef, cockney, drawl, dubya, fudd, funetak, jethro, jive, kraut,
pansy, pirate, postmodern, redneck, valspeak and warez.  Each
programs reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
The package also provides the filters as a C library, so they can
be easily used by other programs.
