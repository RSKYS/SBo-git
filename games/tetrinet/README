tetrinet (networked multiplayer deathmatch Tetris)

Gee, Tetris? Whats that? Yeah, yeah, so it's been done 2 billion
times before (give or take a few bil), but this is different!
Yes, all you tetris addicts out there be prepared for even MORE
excitement.. internet tetris! Now you can play your five best buddies
in one of the most well known games in existence!

This contains the (n)curses client and the server. Note that you'll
have to run the client in a terminal window at least 50 lines high.
Resize or maximize your xterm/konsole/etc window. If you're at the
framebuffer console, try loading a smaller-sized font.

If your F1/F2/F3 keys don't work in this game, you can press Tab to
cycle between the three windows instead. Also, if your arrow keys
don't work (or if you just prefer vi bindings), you can use H J K
L instead.

The tetrinet-server included here is fairly bare-bones, compared to
tetrinetx. However, unlike tetrinetx, it does support the TetriFAST
game mode.
