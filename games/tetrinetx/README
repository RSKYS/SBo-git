tetrinetx (TetriNET server)

tetrinetx provides a server for hosting TetriNet games. TetriNet
is a multiplayer variant of Tetris played over the Internet. Up to
six people may simultaneously connect to a server to participate in
a game.

tetrinetx supports only the original game mode, *not* TetriFAST mode.
Clients attempting to connect in TetriFAST mode will be immediately
disconnected.

If you want to start the tetrinetx service at boot, add code like
this to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tetrinetx ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.tetrinetx start
fi

The daemon runs as the 'games' user. See the tetrinetx(6) man page for
details.

IPv6 support is a compile-time choice. It's not possible to include
both IPv6 and IPv4 support. The default is IPv6. To build with IPv4
support instead, run the script with IPV4=yes in the environment.
