ToME-ah (AnonymousHero's ToME fork) is a game that emphasizes intricate,
challenging, and varied gameplay over graphics. Hundreds of different
monsters in randomly-generated, unpredictable dungeons will strive to
slay you by various means, and you counter--if you survive--by develop-
ing the skills of your choice and wielding mighty artifacts.

You can install ToME-ah alongside other ToME2 versions, but must backup,
delete save folder (~/.tome) between different games.
