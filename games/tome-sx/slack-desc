# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tome-sx: tome-sx (Tales of Middle Earth Sexy Edition - fantasy adventure game)
tome-sx:
tome-sx: ToME-SX (short for "Sexy Edition") is a variant of the roguelike game
tome-sx: ToME, based on version 2.3.5. The scope of this project is to add
tome-sx: variety to the game, change some parts that (according to my personal
tome-sx: opinion) need changing, and provide other people who are interested in
tome-sx: the variant with the possibility of playing and enjoying it too.
tome-sx:
tome-sx: You can install ToME-SX alongside other ToME 2 forks, but will need to
tome-sx: back up, move or delete the save folder (~/.tome) between different
tome-sx: games.
