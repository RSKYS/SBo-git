trackballs (3d marble game)

Trackballs is a game inspired by the 80s Atari classic Marble Madness.

By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with sharp objects,
pools of acid, and other obstacles, the player collects points. When
the destination is reached you continue on to the next, more difficult
level... unless the time runs out.

The music and extra levels from older versions of trackballs are
now included in the package, so you don't have to download them
separately.

Note: I didn't update this for many years, because newer releases
require newer video hardware (with OpenGL 3.3 support). If you're
unable to run the game because of old hardware, let me know (email
address in the .info file).
