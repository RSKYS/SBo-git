# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

transfusion: engine.  Currently not all levels are ported, and only multiplayer

transfusion: You are Caleb, and you are a bad, bad man. You sold your immortal soul
transfusion: for The Dark God, Tchernobog, and you and the other Chosen served
transfusion: Him dutifully until He decided it was time to take everything from
transfusion: you for Himself... apparently, even gods make mistakes.
transfusion: Leaving you to rot in a grave and forgetting about you was a BIG one.
