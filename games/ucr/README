Ultima Classics Revisited (UCR) is an attempt to offer modern
OS-compatible engines for the first six Ultima games. The only completely
playable game for UCR is Akalabeth (aka Ultima 0), and there is a partial
implementation of an Ultima 1 engine.

UCR doesn't require any extra data files to play Akalabeth. If you want
to check out UCR's partial Ultima 1 engine, you'll need the game data
files from Ultima 1 (place them in /usr/share/ucr/games/u1).

Akalabeth is played entirely with the keyboard. Since the keyboard
controls aren't documented anywhere in the UCR source (other than by
reading the C++ code), here's a list of keystrokes:

S - Show character stats (hit points, equipment, etc)
P - Pause/Resume
Space - Pass
F11 - Toggle original/enhanced graphics
F12 - Enable/disable music

Outdoors:
Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows - Move North/South/East/West
E - Enter Town or Castle

In Dungeons:
Up - Move Forward
Down - Turn Around
Left/Right - Turn Left/Right
A - Attack
E - Climb Ladder or Descend into Hole

UCR doesn't support saving the game like the PC version of Akalabeth does.
