Unigine Superposition is an extreme performance and stability test
for PC hardware: video card, power supply, cooling system. Check
your rig in stock and overclocking modes with real-life load! Also
includes interactive experience in a beautiful, detailed environment.

Please note that the source file is 1500mb if you are on a slow
internet connection.  And building the package will take several 
minutes due to its large size. 

Unigine Superposition is 64-bit only.  It will not run on 32-bit
Slackware.
