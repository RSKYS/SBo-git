uqm (port of the 3DO/PC game - Star Control II)

The Ur-Quan Masters is a port of the 3DO version of the PC game "Star
Control II". It runs on modern operating systems and is 100% free.

You may also want the optional uqm_voice, uqm_3domusic and/or
uqm_remixes packages, for a more festive gaming experience.

OpenAL support in uqm is still experimental and thus not autodetected:
use OPENAL=yes in the environment to enable.
