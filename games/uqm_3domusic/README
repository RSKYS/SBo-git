uqm_3domusic (Ur-Quan Masters high-quality in-game music)

The Ur-Quan Masters is a port of the 3DO version of the PC game "Star
Control II". It runs on modern operating systems and is 100% free.

This package contains optional game content that provides high-quality
in-game music. You don't need this package to play the game. Without
this package, there will still be music during the game; it just doesn't
sound as nice.

Note: I'm aware there was a recent uqm-0.8.0-3domusic release.
However, the contents of the .uqm file (which is really just a zip
file) are byte-for-byte identical to the 0.7.0 one, so it seems silly
to upgrade.
