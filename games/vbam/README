vbam (cross-platform GameBoy emulator)

VisualBoyAdvance-M is a Nintendo Game Boy Emulator with high compatibility
with commercial games. It emulates the Nintendo Game Boy Advance hand
held console, in addition to the original Game Boy hand held systems
and its Super and Color variants. VBA-M is a continued development of
the now inactive VisualBoy Advance project, with many improvements from
various developments of VBA.

This application is the wxGTK GUI version of VisualBoyAdvance-M. The
name of the executable is "visualboyadvance-m".

FFMPEG=ON will enable recording and playback. It requires ffmpeg.

There are a couple of alternatives on SBo you might try instead of this
VBAM SlackBuild: vbam-libretro, mgba, and/or libretro-mgba.

Note: when upgrading from 2.0.2 to 2.1.0, you may have to "rm -rf
~/.vbam". Do this if vbam segfaults.
