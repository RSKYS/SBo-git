vkQuake is a Quake 1 port using Vulkan instead of OpenGL for
rendering. It is based on the popular QuakeSpasm port and runs
all mods compatible with it like Arcane Dimensions or In The
Shadows. Compared to QuakeSpasm vkQuake also features a software
Quake like underwater effect, has better color precision, generates
mipmap for water surfaces at runtime and has native support for
anti-aliasing and AF.

Your video card must support the vulkan graphics API for this
port to work.  You can check video card compatibility here

vkQuake is only a game engine modification; you still need the
original quake *.pak game files to play vkQuake.

vkQuake is supported on x86_64 systems only.
