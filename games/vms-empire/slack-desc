# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

vms-empire: vms-empire (simulation terminal game)
vms-empire:
vms-empire: The ancestor of all 4x (expand/explore/exploit/exterminate) games.
vms-empire: Empire is a simulation of a full-scale war between two emperors,
vms-empire: the computer and you. Naturally, there is only room for one, so the
vms-empire: object of the game is to destroy the other. The computer plays by
vms-empire: the same rules that you do. This game was ancestral to all later
vms-empire: expand/explore/exploit/exterminate games, including Civilization
vms-empire: and Master of Orion.
