Warsow - A Fast Paced First Person Shooter Game

Set in a futuristic cartoon-like world where rocketlauncher-wielding 
pigs and lasergun-carrying cyberpunks roam the streets, Warsow is a 
completely free fast-paced first-person shooter (FPS) for Windows, 
Linux and Mac OS X.

Speed and movement, that's what Warsow is all about. Like a true 
cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge and walljump your way through the 
game. Grab those power-ups before your enemy does, plant the bomb 
before anyone sees you, and steal the enemy's flag before anyone 
knows what's going on!
