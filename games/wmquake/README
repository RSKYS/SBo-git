wmquake (Quake as a windowmaker dockapp)

Run id Software's legendary Quake inside a dockapp! Play full on software
Quake, mods, or let it play demos. Fixed by Eukos for newer systems.

You need at least the shareware data files from Quake, available on SBo
as quake_shareware_data. If you have the full version, copy or link its
.pak files into "/usr/share/games/quake/id1".

Notes:

This program will not work correctly on x86_64! You can try it, maybe
you'll have better results than I did, but don't send me a bug report
about 64-bit unless it includes a patch.

Sound will not work because it uses a very old method. It MAY work on
a system with ALSA's OSS emulation enabled (/etc/rc.d/rc.alsa-oss). The
OSS version on SBo (OSS4) will NOT work with this game and neither will
aoss for ALSA users.

If you're looking for wmquake's config file, it's stored in
"~/.wmquake/id1/config.cfg".
