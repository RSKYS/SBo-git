.SH DESCRIPTION
Wolf4SDL is an open\-source port of id Software's classic first\-person
shooter Wolfenstein 3D to the cross\-platform multimedia library "Simple
DirectMedia Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep
the original feel while taking advantage of some modern improvements.
.PP
Wolf4SDL is a game engine. To actually play the game, it requires the
data files from the original game (see \fBFILES\fR, below).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR

Starts the game in the given level
.TP
\fB\-\-baby\fR
Sets the difficulty to baby for tedlevel
.TP
\fB\-\-easy\fR
Sets the difficulty to easy for tedlevel
.TP
\fB\-\-normal\fR

borders).
.TP
\fB\-\-resf\fR <width> <height>
Sets any screen resolution >= 320x200
(which may result in graphic errors, and occasional crashes)

.TP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBWOLF4PATH\fR
Sets the directory where game data files are searched for. When this
variable is not set, the default directory is
\fIPREFIX\fR\fB/share/games/wolf3d\fR (\fIPREFIX\fR was set at
compile time, and defaults to /usr/local).
.PP
Note that data files are always searched for in the current directory
first, regardless of this setting.
.SH FILES
Per\-user config files and saved games are stored in \fB~/.wolf4sdl\fR
.PP
Game data files are searched for \fBfirst\fR in the current directory,
then in \fB$WOLF4PATH\fR (see above). Each game binary uses a different
set of data files:
.TS
box;
cB cB cB
l c r
l c r
l c r

r s r.
Game	Executable	Files
Wolf3D Shareware	wolf4sdl\-wolf\-demo	*.wl1
Wolf3D Registered	wolf4sdl\-wolf\-full	*.wl6 or *.wl3
Spear Demo	wolf4sdl\-spear\-demo	*.sdm
Spear Full Version	wolf4sdl\-spear\-full	*.sod
wolf4sdl\-spear\-full \-\-mission 1	*.sd1
wolf4sdl\-spear\-full \-\-mission 2	*.sd2
wolf4sdl\-spear\-full \-\-mission 3	*.sd3
.TE
.PP
All filenames must be in lowercase (e.g. \fIvgahead.wl1\fR, not \fIVGAHEAD.WL1\fR).
.PP
The Wolf3D and Spear demo/shareware data files can be downloaded from
.br
\fIhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/wolfgl/files/\fR
.br
The files are called \fBwolfdata.zip\fR and \fBsdmdata.zip\fR.
.PP
The full/registered versions are available commercially. After installing
the game (perhaps using DOSBox), the data files will be found in the game's
install directory.
.PP
To play modified versions of the game ("mods"), place the mod's files in
their own directory, cd to that directory, and run the appropriate game
binary. The files in the current directory will be used instead of (or in
addition to) the ones in \fB/usr/share/games/wolf3d\fR. Remember that only
lowercase filenames will work (use "unzip -LL" when extracting). Unfortunately,
many available mods include modified versions of the game engine, which
are only distributed as Windows or DOS executables, with no source. These
are generally unplayable with Wolf4SDL :(
