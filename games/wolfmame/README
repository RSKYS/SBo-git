WolfMAME is a fork of MAME that does not allow pausing, and has other
security features which facilitate the recording of achievements in
arcade games.

Users recorded .inp files will be placed in /opt/wolfmame/inp

use "export MAKEFLAGS=-j4" before building,
e.g. where 4 = # of cores, to speed up compilation.

Note that ccache is used by default. To turn off ccache support, use:

  USE_CCACHE=no ./wolfmame.SlackBuild
