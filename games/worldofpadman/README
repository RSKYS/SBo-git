World of Padman (WoP) is an open source first-person shooter video
game available in both English and German. Originally it was a
modification for the game Quake III Arena titled PadMod created in the
year 2004. After the source code for Quake III Arena was released, the
game became standalone.[1] The idea is based on the Padman comic strip
for the magazine PlayStation Games created by the professional cartoon
artist Andreas 'ENTE' (German for "Duck") Endres, who is also the man
who made many of the maps included with the game in 1998.  The current
version runs on an enhanced version of the ioquake3 engine, which is
based on the Quake III Arena engine.
