xarchon (fantasy-themed board game)

Archon: The Light and the Dark is a 1983 video game developed by Free
Fall Associates and one of the first five games published by Electronic
Arts. It's similar in concept to Chess, except that landing on another
player's piece results in an arcade-style fight to determine the victor.

xarchon is a rewrite of Archon and Archon II: Adept for modern systems.
Single-player against the computer is supported, as well as multiplayer
on the same computer or over the network.

xarchon uses esd (the Enlightened Sound Daemon) for audio. esd must be
running for the game to make sound (e.g. started by ~/.xinitrc, or by
your desktop environment, or manually by typing "esd &" in a terminal).
