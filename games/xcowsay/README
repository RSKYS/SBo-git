xcowsay (display a cute cow and speech bubble)

xcowsay displays a cute cow and message on your desktop. Inspired by
the original cowsay.

xcowsay includes all these amazing features:

 * Fully configurable!
 * Calculates display time from amount of text.
 * Dream mode - display images in the bubble.
 * Can draw thought and speech bubbles.
 * Daemon mode! Send your cow messages over DBus!
 * Three different sized cows provided.
 * fortune(6) wrapper xcowfortune: cow will deliver pearls of wisdom!
 * Replace the naffness that is xmessage(1).
 * Should work with any window manager.
 * Supports UTF-8 characters properly.
 * Use alternative non-cow images if you like.

If you're using older hardware and have problems with this, you may
have better results with xcowsay-1.4. To do this, get the old source:
https://github.com/nickg/xcowsay/releases/download/v1.4/xcowsay-1.4.tar.gz
and run the script with VERSION=1.4 in the environment.
