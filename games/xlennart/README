xlennart is a modification of XBill in which you're defending your
network from spread of SystenD[TM] virus which cleverly disguises
itself as an init process.

You can control which widget sets are compiled in. By default all
of them are enabled but you can disable them by passing ATHENA=no,
MOTIF=no or GTK=no to the script. However at least one needs to
be enabled!

The script has support for making the scoreboard file work across
different users but this is disabled by default since it might
pose a local security risk. You can enable it by passing
SCOREBOARD=yes to the script - it will make the scorefile in
/var/games writeable by users in games group. The file will be
preserved on updates but will also remain on package removal!
