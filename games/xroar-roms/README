xroar-roms (Dragon and CoCo ROM images for use with xroar)

Firmware for Dragon and TRS-80 Color Computer. These were originally
copied from the ROMs in the original machines, and are still under
copyright by the manufacturers, although they've been widely available
on the 'net for years.

The Dragon and CoCo machines (and xroar) have a bewildering array of ROM
images to choose from. What's included here is a "base" set of ROMs.

With this package installed, xroar will be able to run with the
following -machine types:

- dragon32      Dragon 32
- dragon64      Dragon 64
- tano[*]       Tano Dragon (NTSC)
- dragon200e[*] Dragon 200-E
- coco          Tandy CoCo (PAL)
- cocous        Tandy CoCo (NTSC)
- coco2b        Tandy CoCo 2B (PAL,T1)
- coco2bus      Tandy CoCo 2B (NTSC,T1)

[*] Requires extra xroar arguments; see
/usr/doc/xroar-roms-20180901/Readme.txt for details.

The mx1600 (Dynacom MX-1600) is unsupported, as a ROM image couldn't
be found.

There are many ROM, disk, and tape images for the CoCo and Dragon
computers here: http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/
