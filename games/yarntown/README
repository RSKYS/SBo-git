Yarntown is a 2D hommage to Bloodborne, a dark fantasy video game
released on Playstation 4 in 2015. Bloodborne is as renowned for its
demanding and merciless gameplay as for its incredible gothico-victorian
atmosphere. This quest recreates only a part of the original game,
because this is just a little side project.
