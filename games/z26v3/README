z26v3 (an Atari 2600 emulator)

Z26 is one of the best emulators for the Atari 2600. The author reports
that the graphics part of the emulator is nearing perfection to a point
that there's little more to fix.

This is z26 version 3.x, which may have some issues running on Linux
(depending on your hardware & config), and the authors aren't interested
in fixing them. If you have problems you can't solve, try the older 2.13
release, by installing games/z26 (which won't conflict with this build;
you can have both installed).

Specific Linux issues in this version:

- The config file (z26.gui) is always read & written in the directory
  where the ROM image is located. If the file doesn't exist and z26 can't
  write to the directory, it refuses to start. This means no root-owned,
  system-wide /usr/share/games/roms/2600 directory (even if users can
  write there, they'll overwrite each others' config files).

- The video timing relies on OpenGL VSync. If your card/driver combo is
  incapable of this, the games will run insanely fast. Even with VSync
  support, the games run at whatever your monitor refresh rate is set to
  (for LCD panels this is usually 60Hz, which is correct for NTSC games).
