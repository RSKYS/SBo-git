The Zod Engine is a MMORTS / RTS style game. In the game you command
an army of robots and vehicles to take over neighboring territories
in the ultimate goal of destroying all of your enemies. Unlike
traditional RTS (Real Time Strategy) games the Zod Engine  does not
create units from collected resources but instead construction is
constant from preset factories scattered throughout the level.
