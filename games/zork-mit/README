zork-mit (PDP/10 Zork from MIT, circa 1981)

This is a modern C++-17 port of the final 616-point Zork, originally
written in MDL at MIT around 1978-1981.

See also: games/zork and games/dungeon. This version of Zork is newer
than the Dungeon version that was ported to Fortran, but older than
the commercial Zork games for PCs.
