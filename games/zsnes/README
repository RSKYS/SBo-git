zsnes (SNES emulator)

ZSNES is a Super Nintendo emulator programmed by zsKnight and _Demo_.
On April 2, 2001 the ZSNES project was GPL'ed and its source released
to the public. It currently runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and DOS.
Remember that this is a public beta so don't expect this to run on
your machine.

Note to 64-bit users: Since zsnes can't be compiled for 64-bit, a
"statified" 32-bit static binary is used. This allows running zsnes on
a pure 64-bit system, but *without* OpenGL support (meaning the maximum
window size is 640x480). If you use multilib, you can get OpenGL support
by building a 32-bit native zsnes package instead.
