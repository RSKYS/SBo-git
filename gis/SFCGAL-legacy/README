SFCGAL is a C++ wrapper library around CGAL, written with the aim of
supporting ISO 19107:2013 and OGC Simple Features Access 1.2 for 3D
operations.

OpenSceneGraph is an optional dependency enabled by default if found
in your system. If you do not need this, pass the environment variable
to the script:
   OSG=no ./SFCGAL.SlackBuild

SFCGAL-legacy builds version 1.3.9, the lastest compatible with the 
package CGAL available in this repository. If you keep this version
of the dependency, you have to install this package. 

If you have CGAL5 installed in your system, this package is not
compatible and you must refer to the slackbuild SFCGAL based on 
greater versions and also available in this repository.
