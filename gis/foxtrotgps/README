FoxtrotGPS is an easy to use, fast, lightweight mapping application for
use with (or without) GPS.

FoxtrotGPS is an offshoot of Marcus Bauer's tangoGPS.

gpscorrelate and jhead are optional runtime deps - if you install both,
you will be able to geotag photos using the photos' timestamps and the
gps track.
