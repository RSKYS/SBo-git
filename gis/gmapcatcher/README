GMapCatcher is an offline maps viewer. It downloads tiles automatically
from many providers such as: CloudMade, OpenStreetMap, Yahoo Maps,
Google Map. It displays them using a custom GUI. User can view the
maps while offline. GMapCatcher doesn't depend on google-map's java
scripts so it should work even if google changes them. It also provides
a downloading tool.
