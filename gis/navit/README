Navit (gps navigation system with routing engine)

Navit is an open source and free, modular, touch
screen friendly, car navigation system with GPS tracking, realtime
routing engine and support for various vector map formats.

Navit runs on Linux, Windows, Windows CE, Mac OS, Android, iPhone and
webOS. It can use maps from OpenStreetMap and Garmin, among others -
which can be stored offline - so it doesn't need an Internet connection
while in use.

If you want to use a gps receiver device with Navit, such as a usb gps
dongle, you will probably want to install the gpsd package as well.

Navit can be used with maps from the OpenStreetMap project
(https://www.openstreetmap.org). To do this, you will have to download
a map for offline use, using the Navit Planet extractor at:

Optional dependencies: gpsd
