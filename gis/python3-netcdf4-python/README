python3-netcdf4 is a Python3 interface to the netCDF C library.

netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of the
library and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can read and
write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format, and
can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API modelled
after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users of that
module.

Most new features of netCDF 4 are implemented, such as multiple
unlimited dimensions, groups and data compression. All the new numeric
data types (such as 64 bit and unsigned integer types) are implemented.
Compound (struct), variable length (vlen) and enumerated (enum) data
types are supported, but not the opaque data type. Mixtures of compound,
vlen and enum data types (such as compound types containing enums, or
vlens containing compound types) are not supported.
