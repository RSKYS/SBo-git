# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-netcdf4-python: python3-netcdf4-python (Python3 interface for netCDF)
python3-netcdf4-python:
python3-netcdf4-python: netcdf4-python is a Python/numpy interface to the netCDF C library.
python3-netcdf4-python:
python3-netcdf4-python: netCDF version 4 has many features not found in earlier versions of
python3-netcdf4-python: the library and is implemented on top of HDF5. This module can read
python3-netcdf4-python: and write files in both the new netCDF 4 and the old netCDF 3 format,
python3-netcdf4-python: and can create files that are readable by HDF5 clients. The API
python3-netcdf4-python: modelled after Scientific.IO.NetCDF, and should be familiar to users
python3-netcdf4-python: of that module.
