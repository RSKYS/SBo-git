QGIS is a user friendly Geographic Information System that lets you
view and manipulate spatial data on your computer.  It supports many
common spatial data formats (e.g. PostGIS, ShapeFile and geotiff).

The installation of QGIS from sources can result strongly different
depending on the optional/required packages installed and enabled. This
slackbuild is based on basic and some optional settings that require
the dependencies (and related nested deps) reported in the REQUIRES
field of qgis.info.

For further information see the README.Slackware file.
