ART is a free, open-source, cross-platform raw image processing
program. It is a derivative of RawTherapee, trading a bit of
customization and control over various processing parameters for a
simpler and easier to use interface, while still maintaining the power
and quality of RawTherapee. Some features have been added too, including
local editing and masks, a perspective correction tool, and better
metadata handling.

opencolorio is a optional but highly recommended dependency to add
support for ACES CLF LUTs.

rawtherapee-haldclut is an optional dependency, which adds film
simulations to both ART and RawTherapee.
