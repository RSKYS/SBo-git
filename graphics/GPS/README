GIMP Paint Studio is a creative commons set of tool presets,
brush presets, color swatches, patterns, and config files that will
transform the GNU Image Manipulation Program into a robust painting and
materials-emulation application.  Great for painters, airbrushing and
re-touching, and illustrators.

WARNING:
This OVERWRITES any config files you have in ~/.gimp-2.8
so if you've got customizations, back them up first.

NOTE:
If using GIMP 2.10 as a Flatpak, you must add ``/usr/share/gimp/2.0/``
to your Folders path in Edit > Preferences > Folder.
You must do this for each item you want GIMP to see (brushes, patterns,
and so on).
