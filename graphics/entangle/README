Entangle provides a graphical interface for tethered camera control
and capture, which means taking photographs with a digital camera 
completely controlled from the computer.

With a sufficiently capable digital SLR camera, Entangle allows to:

- Trigger the shutter from the computer
- Live preview of the scene before shooting
- Automatic download and display of photos as they are shot
- Control of all camera settings from the computer

Licensed under the GNU GPL v3+, it is built on top of libgphoto
and uses GTK3 for its interface. It is fully colour-managed, auto-
detects the system's monitor profile and applies the necessary
transforms when displaying images.
