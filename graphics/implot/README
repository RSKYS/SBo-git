ImPlot is an immediate mode, GPU accelerated plotting library for Dear
ImGui. It aims to provide a first-class API that ImGui fans will love.
ImPlot is well suited for visualizing program data in real-time or
creating interactive plots, and requires minimal code to integrate.
Just like ImGui, it does not burden the end user with GUI state
management, avoids STL containers and C++ headers, and has no external
dependencies except for ImGui itself.
