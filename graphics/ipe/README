Ipe is a drawing editor for creating figures in PDF format. It supports
making small figures for inclusion into LaTeX-documents as well as
making multi-page PDF presentations.

Ipe's main features are:
* Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to enter
  mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of the main
  document. In the display text is displayed as it will appear in the
  figure.
* Produces pure PDF, including the text. Ipe converts the LaTeX-source
  to PDF when the file is saved.
* It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for instance,
  to place a point on the intersection of two lines, or to draw a circle
  through three given points) using various snapping modes.
* Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add functionality to Ipe.
  This way, Ipe can be extended for each task at hand.
