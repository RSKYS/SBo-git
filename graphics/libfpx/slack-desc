# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libfpx: libfpx (A library for manipulating FlashPIX images)
libfpx:
libfpx: FlashPix is a bitmapped computer graphics file format where the image
libfpx: is saved in more than one resolution. Although this makes it larger
libfpx: even than a TIFF file of the same resolution, its design anticipated
libfpx: that when an HTTP request is sent for the file by a browser plugin
libfpx: implementing the format, only the image compatible with the current
libfpx: screen resolution is returned to the browser, saving on bandwidth
libfpx: and download time.
