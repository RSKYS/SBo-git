Mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap font
into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font).  Type1 fonts
offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow PostScript files
to render correctly on printers with many resolutions.  Moreover,
Ghostscript can generate much better PDF, if given scalable fonts.

Mftrace requires a tracing program, either potrace or autotrace.
If both are installed, potrace is chosen by default.

fontforge is an optional recommended dependency.
