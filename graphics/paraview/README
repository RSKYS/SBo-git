ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and
visualization application. ParaView users can quickly build
visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and
quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be done
interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch
processing capabilities.

This SlackBuild, in line with official Paraview releases,
is intended only for 64bit systems.

MPI support requires build time installation of mpich or openmpi,
both available from SBo but which should not both be installed
at the same time. In addition, the PV_USE_MPI environment variable
should be set to "yes" e.g.
    PV_USE_MPI=yes sh paraview.SlackBuild
