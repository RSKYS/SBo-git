# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

peek: Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of a screen area. With
peek: Peek, you simply place the Peek window over the area you want to
peek: record and press "Record". Peek is optimized for generating animated
peek: GIFs, but you can also directly record to WebM or MP4 if you prefer.
