psftools (tools for converting between bitmap font formats)

The PSF Tools are an attempt to do something similar to NetPBM
for simple fixed-width bitmap fonts. It supports at least these
font formats:

- Linux console .PSF/.PSFU
- X11 .BDF
- MS-DOS .CPI
- Windows .FNT and .FON
- IBM MDA (Monochrome Display Adaptor)
- BBC Micro
- ZX Spectrum
- Wyse-60
- Hercules WriteOn
- Raw bitmaps

...and can also convert fonts to XBM, PBM, C source, and human
readable text files. psftools can also merge font files together,
and transform them in various ways (scaling, flipping, adjusting the
bounding box, etc).

The package also includes few console fonts, taken from the open source
release of the GEM operating system.
