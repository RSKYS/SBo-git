qcomicbook (comic book reader)

QComicBook is a viewer for PDF files and comic book archives
containing jpeg/png/xpm/gif/bmp images, which aims at convenience
and simplicity. Features include: automatic unpacking of archive
files, full-screen mode, continuous scrolling mode, double-pages
viewing, manga mode, thumbnails view, page scaling, mouse or keyboard
navigation etc.

Optional, but highly recommended:

unrar - required for .cbr files.
p7zip - required for .cb7 files.
unace - required for .cba files (which are pretty rare).

These are runtime dependencies; you don't have to rebuild qcomicbook
after installing them.
