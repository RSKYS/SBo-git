ScanTailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages. It
performs operations such as:
  * page splitting,
  * deskewing,
  * adding/removing borders,
  * selecting content
  * ... and others.
You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or
assembled into a PDF or DjVu file. Scanning, optical character
recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of
this project.

The ScanTailor version that merges the features of the ScanTailor
Featured and ScanTailor Enhanced versions, brings new ones and fixes.
