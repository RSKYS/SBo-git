Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program. You can take a screenshot
of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a website -
apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight points, and then
upload to an image hosting site, all within one window. Shutter is free,
open-source, and licensed under GPL v3.
