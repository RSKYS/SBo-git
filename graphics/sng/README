sng (lossless editing of PNGs via text representation)

SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed 
specifically to represent the entire contents of a PNG (Portable 
Network Graphics) file in an editable form. Thus, SNGs representing 
elaborate graphics images and ancillary chunk data can be readily 
generated or modified using only text tools.
