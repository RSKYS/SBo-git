teighaviewer (AutoCAD DWG and DGN file viewer)

TeighaViewer is a free rendering application, which can render
.dwg and .dgn files. These are CAD files, usually used with AutoCAD.

This is an older, 32-bit-only version of teighaviewer. It will
not be updated to a newer version for technical reasons. See
README_maintainer.txt for details.
