Tux Paint: Open Source Drawing Software for Children

"Tux Paint" is a drawing program for young children.  It provides a
simple interface and fixed canvas size, and provides access to previous
images using a thumbnail browser (e.g., no access to the underlying
file-system).  Unlike popular drawing programs like "The GIMP," it has
a very limited tool-set. However, it provides a much simpler interface,
and has entertaining, child-oriented additions such as sound effects.
tuxpaint-config is now also included as a gui tool to configure
tuxpaint.

Note: Please uninstall inkscape before creating this package if you
want to avoid a couple of file artifacts outside the package directory.

This is the sdl2 version of the program. Note: dependencies have changed
