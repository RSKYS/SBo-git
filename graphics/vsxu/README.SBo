The source tarball downloadable directly from the vsxu github repository
does not contain any of the git submodules required to build the project.
We therefore supply at slackbuilddirectlinks that contains the necessary
submodules. The difference in content is denoted by the versions number;
a ".0" is added to the "eqivalent" github version e.g. if the github tarball
were named vsxu-0.6.1.tar.gz then the more complete slackbuilddirectlinks
tarball would be named vsxu-0.6.1.0.tar.gz. Such updated tarballs are
constructed using the following shell commands (again using 0.6.1 as an
example version):

git clone --recursive -b v0.6.1 https://github.com/vovoid/vsxu.git vsxu-0.6.1.0
tar zcv --exclude=".git*" -f vsxu-0.6.1.0.tar.gz vsxu-0.6.1.0
