white_dune is a graphical VRML97/X3D editor, simple NURBS/Superformula
3D modeller, animation tool and VRML97/X3DV commandline compiler.

With white_dune you can create/change 3D objects and animate them
(in a easy way if you choose the -4kids GUI).
The result can be shown in any WebGL enabled web browser or can be
converted to the RIB format for movie creation.

For a full featured compile, you need to install cgal and vcglib, but
the program is also usefull without these libraries.
