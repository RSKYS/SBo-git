# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

7plus: 7plus (encoder vaguely similar to Unix's UUENCODE)
7plus:
7plus: It uses a very effective radix216 encoding and incorporates diverse
7plus: mechanisms to ensure decoded data is not corrupted. It also includes
7plus: an interactive repair mechanism which allows the repair of damaged
7plus: files using correction files, thus eliminating the need to retransmit
7plus: entire files. In case of a corruption, only the faulty sections are
7plus: resent. 7PLUS is only meant to be used within the Packet Radio network
7plus: for the tranport of binary data through Packet Radio mail. It cannot
7plus: be used for Internet eMail since it needs a (almost) transparent path
7plus: from end to end."
