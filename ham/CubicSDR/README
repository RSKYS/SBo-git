CubicSDR is the software portion of Software Defined Radio. By using
hardware that converts RF spectrum into a digital stream we are able to
build complex radios to do many types of functions in software instead
of traditional hardware.

Paired with a supported hardware receiver, you can use CubicSDR to
explore the RF world around you. Discover Satellite transmissions,
Amateur Radio, Rail, Aeronautical, Shortwave, or any number of possible
signals floating through the air.
