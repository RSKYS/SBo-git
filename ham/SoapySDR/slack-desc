# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

SoapySDR: SoapySDR (vendor and platform neutral SDR support library)
SoapySDR:
SoapySDR: SoapySDR is an open-source generalized C/C++ API and runtime library
SoapySDR: for interfacing with SDR devices. With SoapySDR, you can instantiate,
SoapySDR: configure, and stream with an SDR device in a variety of
SoapySDR: environments. Both osmosdr and uhd devices are available within
SoapySDR: SoapySDR. In addition, vendors can directly support their hardware
SoapySDR: using SoapySDR device modules. There are wrappers for both gr-osmosdr,
SoapySDR: uhd, and gr-uhd to bring an ecosystem of existing applications to
SoapySDR: SoapySDR devices. And SoapySDR has support for powerful platforms like
SoapySDR: GNU Radio and Pothos.
