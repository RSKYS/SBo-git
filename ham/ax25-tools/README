ax25-tools AX.25 Packet radio support for linux (additional tools)

The AX.25 protocol offers both connected and connectionless modes of
operation, and is used either by itself for point-point links, or to
carry other protocols such as TCP/IP and NET/ROM.

It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to
make it more useful in the amateur radio environment.

These are hamradio specific tools for setting up and configuring
hamradio ports that use AX.25 Net/ROM or ROSE network protocols.
