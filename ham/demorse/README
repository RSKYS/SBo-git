demorse is a Morse code decoding application for the console. It 
detects the receiver's audio output via the computer's sound card, 
using simple dsp techniques, and then decodes the mark/space 
sequence into characters which are printed on the console screen. 
demorse has some tolerance to bad operator "fists" and noise or 
interference. demorse can measure and adapt to the Morse transmission's 
speed within the range of 10-30 words per minute, the default 
starting speed being set to about 20 wpm.
