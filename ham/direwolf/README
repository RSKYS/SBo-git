Dire Wolf is a software "soundcard" modem/TNC and APRS * 
encoder/decoder.   It can be used stand-alone to receive APRS 
messages, as a digipeater, APRStt gateway, or Internet Gateway 
(IGate).    It can also be used as a virtual TNC for other 
applications such as APRSIS32, UI-View32, Xastir, APRS-TW, YAAC, 
UISS, Linux AX25, SARTrack, and many others.

You'll need to edit the config file before first run to specify
soundcard, etc.
