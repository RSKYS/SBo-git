FLRIG is a transceiver control program for Amateur Radio use.
It is designed to be used either stand alone or as an adjunct to FLDIGI.
It does not use any 3rd party transceiver control libraries.
The supported transceivers all have some degree of CAT. The FLRIG user
nterface changes to accommodate the degree of CAT support available for
the transceiver in use.
