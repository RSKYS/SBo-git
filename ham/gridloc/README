gridloc is a ncurses console application for the calculation of 
Maidenhead QRA Locators from location co-ordinates, and vice 
versa. gridloc also calculates distance and direction (long-path 
or short-path) from a "home" location to another (DX) location.

The package places a /usr/doc/gridloc/.gridlocrc on your system.
If you copy this to the $HOME of your user, it will use this
config file.
