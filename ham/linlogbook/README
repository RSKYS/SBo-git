LinLogBook is a highly configurable loogbook for linux. 
It uses an sql- database to store its data. For the ease 
of use sqlite 3 is used but it should be possible to use 
other databases like mysql, for instance.

LinLogBook is a companion program to LinPSK, and can
pull data directly from it. LinPSK is also available
at SlackBuilds.org.
