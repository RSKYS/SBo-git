# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

liquid-dsp: liquid-dsp (Software-Defined Radio Digital Signal Processing Library)
liquid-dsp:
liquid-dsp: liquid-dsp is the software portion of Software Defined Radio. By using
liquid-dsp: hardware that converts RF spectrum into a digital stream we are able
liquid-dsp: to build complex radios to do many types of functions in software
liquid-dsp: instead of traditional hardwre.
