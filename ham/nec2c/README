nec2c is a translation of the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC2) 
from FORTRAN to C. Operationally nec2c differs from NEC2 by being a 
command line non-interactive program, taking as arguments the input 
file name and optionally the output file name. 

NEC simulates the electromagnetic response of antennas and metal 
structures.
