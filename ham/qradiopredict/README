qradiopredict is an experimental software for VHF-UHF propagation 
prediction and radio coverage analysis. qradiopredict can operate 
as a traditional standalone program with static plots and radio 
links, or can be connected to Flightgear, the free flight simulator, 
in order to use it's powerful radio simulation.

Flightgear is an optional dependency.
