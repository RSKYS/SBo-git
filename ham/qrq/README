qrq - yet another CW trainer (Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows)

qrq is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer which runs on several
operating systems (Linux, Unix, OS X and Windows), similar to the
classic DOS version of Rufz by DL4MM.

The script now builds with PulseAudio support.  If OSS support is
desired, the option 'USE_PA=NO' will need to be appended to the
make command (see comment in qrq.SlackBuild) before the package is
built.
