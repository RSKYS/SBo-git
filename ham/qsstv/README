QSSTV 9 is a program for receiving and transmitting SSTV and HAMDRM
(sometimes called DSSTV).
It is compatible with most of MMSSTV and EasyPal.

Please observe that Qt5 is required in order to build on Slackware
14.2. Since building Qt5, even from SBo, can be quite a hard task,
I've tested the script with the Qt5 prebuilt package from AlienBOB's
repository.
