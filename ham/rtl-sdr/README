Turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a SDR receiver
DVB-T dongles based on the Realtek RTL2832U can be used as a
cheap SDR, since the chip allows transferring the raw I/Q
samples to the host, which is officially used for DAB/DAB+/FM
demodulation.

Below are some paramaters that can be passed to the slackbuild
to turn on some optional components.

RULES=yes|no (Default is no) In order to be able to use the
dongle as a non-root user, you may install the appropriate
udev rules

DETACHING=yes|no (Default is no) kernel driver detaching
