# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

svxlink:
svxlink: The SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system,
svxlink: which when connected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced
svxlink: repeater system and can also operate on a simplex channel. One could
svxlink: call it a radio operating system since it sits between the hardware
svxlink: (transceiver) and the applications (modules) and handle basic system
svxlink: services as well as input and output.
svxlink: The project also includes Qtel and SvxReflector.
