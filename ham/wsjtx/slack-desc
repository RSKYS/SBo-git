# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wsjtx: wsjtx (Weak Signal Communication, by K1JT)
wsjtx:
wsjtx: Offers specific digital protocols optimized for EME (moonbounce),
wsjtx: meteor scatter, and ionospheric scatter, at VHF/UHF, as well as for
wsjtx: LF, MF, and HF propagation.  The program can decode
wsjtx: fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from ionized meteor trails
wsjtx: and steady signals more than 10 dB below the audible threshold.
