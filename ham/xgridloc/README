xgridloc is a GTK+ graphical version of gridloc and performs 
the same basic functions, but additionally it can use xplanet 
to display the home and DX locations and the great circle 
path between them.

gridloc is a program that accepts latitude and longitude and
returns the Maidenhead grid locator.

By default, xgridloc wants to install .xgridlocrc to the
installing user's $HOME. This SlackBuild patches that out
of make install, and instead drops it in the doc directory
so that end users can copy it down themselves.

xplanet is an optional dependency.
