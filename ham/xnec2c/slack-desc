# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xnec2c:
xnec2c: xnec2c is the graphical counterpart of nec2c, which in turn is a
xnec2c: port of the classic nec2 antenna visualization program from Fortran
xnec2c: to the C programming language.  xnec2c accepts nec2 output files and
xnec2c: displays a graphical representation of the data.  xnec2c uses the
