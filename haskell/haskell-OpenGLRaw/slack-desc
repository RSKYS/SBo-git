# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-OpenGLRaw: haskell-OpenGLRaw (A raw binding for the OpenGL graphics system)
haskell-OpenGLRaw:
haskell-OpenGLRaw: OpenGLRaw is a raw Haskell binding for the OpenGL 3.2 graphics
haskell-OpenGLRaw: system and lots of OpenGL extensions.  It is basically a 1:1 mapping
haskell-OpenGLRaw: of OpenGL's C API, intended as a basis for a nicer interface.
haskell-OpenGLRaw: OpenGLRaw offers access to all necessary functions, tokens and types
haskell-OpenGLRaw: plus a general facility for loading extension entries.  The module
haskell-OpenGLRaw: hierarchy closely mirrors the naming structure of the OpenGL
haskell-OpenGLRaw: extensions, making it easy to find the right module to import.  All
haskell-OpenGLRaw: API entries are loaded dynamically.  If an API entry is not found at
haskell-OpenGLRaw: runtime, a userError is thrown.
