QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties.
The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form
of properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then
tests that the properties hold in a large number of randomly
generated cases.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
