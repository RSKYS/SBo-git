# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-SHA: haskell-SHA (Implementations of the SHA suite of functions)
haskell-SHA:
haskell-SHA: This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions,
haskell-SHA: according to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well as
haskell-SHA: the SHA-based HMAC routines. The functions have been tested against
haskell-SHA: most of the NIST and RFC test vectors for the various functions.
haskell-SHA: While some attention has been paid to performance, these do not
haskell-SHA: presently reach the speed of well-tuned libraries, like OpenSSL.
