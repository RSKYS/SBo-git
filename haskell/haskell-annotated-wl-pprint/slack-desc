# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-annotated-wl-pprint: haskell-annotated-wl-pprint (Wadler/Leijen Pretty Printer)
haskell-annotated-wl-pprint:
haskell-annotated-wl-pprint: This is a modified version of wl-pprint, which was based on Wadler's
haskell-annotated-wl-pprint: paper "A Prettier Printer". See the haddocks for full info. This
haskell-annotated-wl-pprint: version allows the library user to annotate the text with semantic
haskell-annotated-wl-pprint: information, which can later be rendered in a variety of ways.
