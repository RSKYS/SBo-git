# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-auto-update: haskell-auto-update (periodic, on-demand actions)
haskell-auto-update:
haskell-auto-update: A common problem is the desire to have an action run at a scheduled
haskell-auto-update: interval, but only if it is needed. This library allows you to define
haskell-auto-update: actions which will either be performed by a dedicated thread or,
haskell-auto-update: in times of low volume, will be executed by the calling thread.
