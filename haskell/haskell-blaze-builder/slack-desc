# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-blaze-builder: haskell-blaze-builder (Efficient buffered output)
haskell-blaze-builder:
haskell-blaze-builder: This library provides an abstraction of buffered output of byte
haskell-blaze-builder: streams and several convenience functions to exploit it.  For
haskell-blaze-builder: example, it allows to efficiently serialize Haskell values to lazy
haskell-blaze-builder: bytestrings with a large average chunk size.  The large average
haskell-blaze-builder: chunk size allows to make good use of cache prefetching in later
haskell-blaze-builder: processing steps (e.g. compression) and reduces the sytem call
haskell-blaze-builder: overhead when writing the resulting lazy bytestring to a file or
haskell-blaze-builder: sending it over the network.
