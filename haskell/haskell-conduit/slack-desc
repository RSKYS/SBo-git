# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-conduit: haskell-conduit (Streaming data processing library)
haskell-conduit:
haskell-conduit: conduit is a solution to the streaming data problem, allowing for
haskell-conduit: production, transformation, and consumption of streams of data in
haskell-conduit: constant memory. It is an alternative to lazy I/O which guarantees
haskell-conduit: deterministic resource handling, and fits in the same general
haskell-conduit: solution space as enumerator/iteratee and pipes.
