A library that performs fast, accurate conversion between double
precision floating point and text.

This library is implemented as bindings to the C++ double-conversion
library written by Florian Loitsch at Google:
https://github.com/floitsch/double-conversion.

The Text versions of these functions are about 30 times faster than the
default show implementation for the Double type.

The ByteString versions are slower than the Text versions; roughly half
the speed. (This seems to be due to the cost of allocating ByteString
values via malloc.)

As a final note, be aware that the bytestring-show package is about 50%
slower than simply using show.
