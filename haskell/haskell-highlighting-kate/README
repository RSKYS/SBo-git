highlighting-kate is a syntax highlighting library with support for
nearly one hundred languages.  The syntax parsers are automatically
generated from Kate syntax descriptions (https://kate-editor.org/),
so any syntax supported by Kate can be added.  A command-line
program is provided, along with a utility for generating new parsers
from Kate XML syntax descriptions.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
