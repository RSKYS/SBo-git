# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-hslogger: haskell-hslogger (Versatile logging framework)
haskell-hslogger:
haskell-hslogger: hslogger is a logging framework for Haskell, roughly similar to
haskell-hslogger: Python's logging module.
haskell-hslogger:
haskell-hslogger: hslogger lets each log message have a priority and source be
haskell-hslogger: associated with it. The programmer can then define global handlers
haskell-hslogger: that route or filter messages based on the priority and
haskell-hslogger: source. hslogger also has a syslog handler built in.
