The Haskell XML Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing
XML documents including the DTD subset and the document subset.
It contains a validating XML parser, an HTML parser, namespace
support, an XPath expression evaluator, an XSLT library, a RelaxNG
schema validator and functions for serialization and deserialization
of user defined data.
