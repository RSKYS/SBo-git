This package lets you automatically generate lenses for data types;
code was extracted from the lens package, and therefore generated
lenses are fully compatible with ones generated by lens (and can be
used both from lens and microlens). This package is a part of the
microlens family.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
