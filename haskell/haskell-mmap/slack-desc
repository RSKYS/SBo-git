# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-mmap:
haskell-mmap: This library provides a wrapper to mmap(2) or MapViewOfFile,
haskell-mmap: allowing files or devices to be lazily loaded into memory as strict
haskell-mmap: or lazy ByteStrings, ForeignPtrs or plain Ptrs, using the virtual
haskell-mmap: memory subsystem to do on-demand loading. Modifications are also
haskell-mmap: supported.
