# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-monad-control:
haskell-monad-control: This package defines the type class MonadBaseControl, a subset of
haskell-monad-control: MonadBase into which generic control operations such as catch can be
haskell-monad-control: lifted from IO or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad
haskell-monad-control: transformers in MonadTransControl, which includes all standard monad
haskell-monad-control: transformers in the transformers library except ContT.
