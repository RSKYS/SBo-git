# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-mono-traversable:
haskell-mono-traversable: Type classes for mapping, folding, and traversing monomorphic and
haskell-mono-traversable: polymorphic containers. Haskell is good at operating over polymorphic
haskell-mono-traversable: containers such as a list [a]. A monomorphic container is one such
haskell-mono-traversable: as Text which has a type Text that does not expose a type variable
