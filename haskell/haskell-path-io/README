This package provides an interface to the directory package for users
of Chris Done's path. It also implements some missing stuff like
recursive scanning and copying of directories, working with temporary
files/directories, etc.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
