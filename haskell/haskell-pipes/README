pipes is a clean and powerful stream processing library that lets you
build and connect reusable streaming components

Advantages over traditional streaming libraries:
 * Concise API: Use simple commands like for, (>->), await, and yield
 * Blazing fast: Implementation tuned for speed, including shortcut
   fusion
 * Lightweight Dependency: pipes is small and compiles very rapidly,
   including dependencies
 * Elegant semantics: Use practical category theory
 * ListT: Correct implementation of ListT that interconverts with pipes
 * Bidirectionality: Implement duplex channels
 * Extensive Documentation: Second to none!
