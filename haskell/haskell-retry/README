Retry combinators for monadic actions that may fail.

This package exposes combinators that can wrap arbitrary monadic
actions. They run the action and potentially retry running it with some
configurable delay for a configurable number of times. The purpose is
to make it easier to work with IO and especially network IO actions
that often experience temporary failure and warrant retrying of the
original action. For example, a database query may time out for a
while, in which case we should hang back for a bit and retry the query
instead of simply raising an exception.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
