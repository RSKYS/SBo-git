# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-semigroups: In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of
haskell-semigroups: a set together with an associative binary operation. A semigroup
haskell-semigroups: generalizes a monoid in that there might not exist an identity
haskell-semigroups: element. It also (originally) generalized a group (a monoid with all
haskell-semigroups: inverses) to a type where every element did not have to have an
haskell-semigroups: inverse, thus the name semigroup.
