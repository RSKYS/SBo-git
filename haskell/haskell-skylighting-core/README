Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library. It derives its tokenizers
from XML syntax definitions used by KDE's KSyntaxHighlighting
framework, so any syntax supported by that framework can be added. This
package provides the core highlighting functionality under a permissive
license. It also bundles XML parser definitions licensed under the GPL.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
