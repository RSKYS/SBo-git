# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-skylighting-core: haskell-skylighting-core (syntax highlighting library)
haskell-skylighting-core:
haskell-skylighting-core: Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library. It derives
haskell-skylighting-core: its tokenizers from XML syntax definitions used by KDE's
haskell-skylighting-core: KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any syntax supported by that
haskell-skylighting-core: framework can be added. This package provides the core highlighting
haskell-skylighting-core: functionality under a permissive license. It also bundles XML parser
haskell-skylighting-core: definitions licensed under the GPL.
