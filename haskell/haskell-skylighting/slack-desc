# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-skylighting:
haskell-skylighting: Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library with support for
haskell-skylighting: over one hundred languages. It derives its tokenizers from XML
haskell-skylighting: syntax definitions used by KDE's KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so
haskell-skylighting: any syntax supported by that framework can be added. An optional
haskell-skylighting: command-line program is provided. Skylighting is intended to be
haskell-skylighting: the successor to highlighting-kate.
