# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-tar: haskell-tar (Reading, writing and manipulating ".tar" archive files)
haskell-tar:
haskell-tar: This library is for working with ".tar" archive files. It can read
haskell-tar: and write a range of common variations of archive format including
haskell-tar: V7, USTAR, POSIX and GNU formats.  It provides support for packing
haskell-tar: and unpacking portable archives.  This makes it suitable for
haskell-tar: distribution but not backup because details like file ownership and
haskell-tar: exact permissions are not preserved.
