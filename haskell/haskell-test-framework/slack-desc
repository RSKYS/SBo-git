# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-test-framework: Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to
haskell-test-framework: be assembled into test groups, run in parallel (but reported in
haskell-test-framework: deterministic order, to aid diff interpretation) and filtered and
haskell-test-framework: controlled by command line options.  All of this comes with colored
haskell-test-framework: test output, progress reporting and test statistics output.
