# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-th-reify-many: haskell-th-reify-many (reify template haskell datatype info)
haskell-th-reify-many:
haskell-th-reify-many: th-reify-many provides functions for recursively reifying top level
haskell-th-reify-many: declarations. The main intended use case is for enumerating the names
haskell-th-reify-many: of datatypes reachable from an initial datatype, and passing these
haskell-th-reify-many: names to some function which generates instances.
