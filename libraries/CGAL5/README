The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) provides 
efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++
library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation,
such as computer graphics, scientific visualization, computer aided
design and modelling, geographic information systems, molecular 
biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion planning, mesh generation
and numerical methods.

Since version 5.0, GGAL is a header-only library and does not need to 
be compiled. This package contains a version greater than 4.x, required
by some packages (for example SFCGAL version 1.4.x). It conflicts with
versions earlier than 5.0, hence CGAL5 is an alternative that cannot
coexist with the package CGAL also available in this repository. 

Packages that depend on CGAL may be incompatible with CGAL5 and vice 
versa. Please make sure which package you really need, depending on the
software installed or to be installed on your system.
