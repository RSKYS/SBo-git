DirectFB (Thin library on top of the Linux framebuffer devices)

DirectFB is a thin library that provides hardware graphics
acceleration, input device handling and abstraction, integrated
windowing system with support for translucent windows and multiple
display layers, not only on top of the Linux Framebuffer Device. It
is a complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for
every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying
hardware. 

If you experience difficulties with your mouse or keyboard within a
DirectFB application, create the /etc/directfbrc configuration file
and try adding the following directives, as appropriate:

  disable-module=keyboard
  disable-module=ps2mouse
  disable-module=serialmouse

Read directfbrc(5) for more details on configuring the DirectFB library.
