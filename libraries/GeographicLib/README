GeographicLib is a small C++ library for: geodesic and rhumb line
calculations; conversions between geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS,
geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates; gravity (e.g., EGM2008)
and geomagnetic field (e.g., WMM2020) calculations.

The emphasis is on returning accurate results with errors close to
round-off (about 5â€“15 nanometers). Accurate algorithms for Geodesics
on an ellipsoid of revolution and Transverse Mercator projection have
been developed for this library. The functionality of the library can
be accessed from user code or from the Utility programs provided.

This library is not a general purpose projection library nor does it
perform datum conversions; use PROJ instead.


NOTE - This SlackBuild installs the following data sets: egm96-5
(geoid), egm96 (gravity) and wmm2020 (magnetic), provided that they
have been downloaded and placed in the SlackBuild's directory, along
with the source tarball. Several other data sets are available on the
project's website, or can be downloaded and installed automatically
by using the following scripts, after installation of the package:

  /usr/sbin/geographiclib-get-geoids
  /usr/sbin/geographiclib-get-gravity
  /usr/sbin/geographiclib-get-magnetic
