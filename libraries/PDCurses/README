PDCurses is a public domain curses library for DOS, OS/2, Win32, X11
and SDL, implementing most of the functions available in X/Open and
System V R4 curses. It supports many compilers for these platforms.
The X11 port lets you recompile existing text-mode curses programs
to produce native X11 applications.
