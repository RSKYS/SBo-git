An audio library based on PortAudio, CFFI and NumPy

PySoundCard can play and record audio.
Audio devices are supported through PortAudio, which is a free,
cross-platform, open-source audio I/O library that runs on many
operating systems including Windows, OS X and Linux.  It is accessed
through CFFI, which is a foreign function interface for Python
calling C code. CFFI is supported for CPython 2.6+, 3.x and PyPy
2.0+. PySoundCard represents audio data as NumPy arrays.
