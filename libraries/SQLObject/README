SQLObject is a popular Object Relational Manager for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.  SQLObject includes a
Python-object-based query language that makes SQL more abstract, and
provides substantial database independence for applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB
(SAPDB).

NOTE: SQLObject checks for supported databases at run time.  You can
use the MySQL-python and psycopg2 (MySQL and PostrgreSQL support,
respectively) optional dependencies.  For SQLite, SQLObject can
use the standard Python module sqlite3, or an externally installed
PySQLite2.  For the rest, check the SQLObject documentation for links.
