Open Asset Import Library is a Open Source library designed to
load various 3d file formats and convert them into a shared,
in-memory format. It supports more than 30 file formats (basically,
it is like DevIL for 3D models). It also supports exporting, but the
number of export formats is lower.

Optional dependency: libminizip
