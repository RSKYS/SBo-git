ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) is an  ongoing
research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in order to
provide portable performance. At present, it provides C and Fortran77
interfaces to a portably efficient BLAS implementation, as well as a few
routines from LAPACK. Nevertheless, by default, this SlackBuild also
builds a full LAPACK linked with ATLAS. If you are really sure that you
don't want this, set LAPACK_SOURCE to the empty string when running this
script.

This conflicts with cblas and lapack (not to be confused with lapack-atlas).
Nevertheless, it should be possible to avoid these conflicts by proper use
of the SYS_DESTDIR variable.

The impatient may just switch CPU throttling off and run the script, but
you are advised to read over README.SLACKWARE *in advance*.
