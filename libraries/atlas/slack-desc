# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

atlas: This is ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software), an
atlas: ongoing research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in
atlas: order to provide portable performance.  At present, it provides C and
atlas: Fortran77 interfaces to a portably efficient BLAS implementation as
atlas: well as a few routines from LAPACK. Nevertheless, the default setting
atlas: for Slackware is to allow for a full LAPACK to get build and installed
atlas: along with ATLAS.
