.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBaubiomfcc\fP compute the Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC).
.PP
MFCCs are coefficients that make up for the mel-frequency spectrum, a
representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound. By default, 13
coefficients are computed using 40 filters.
.PP
When started with an input \fIsource\fP (\fB-i\fP/\fB--input\fP), the coefficients are given on
the console, prefixed by their timestamps in seconds.
.SH OPTIONS

This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP, \fB--input\fP \fIsource\fP
Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP, \fB--samplerate\fP \fIrate\fP
Fetch the input \fIsource\fP, resampled at the given
sampling \fIrate\fP. The \fIrate\fP should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
the sampling \fIrate\fP of the original \fIsource\fP will be used. Defaults to 0.
.TP
.B
\fB-B\fP, \fB--bufsize\fP \fIwin\fP
The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.
.TP
.B
\fB-H\fP, \fB--hopsize\fP \fIhop\fP
The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
Defaults to 256.
.TP
.B
\fB-T\fP, \fB--timeformat\fP format
Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
seconds.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
Print a short help message and exit.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP
Be verbose.

Using the default parameters, the filter coefficients will be computed
