.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBaubionotes\fP attempts to detect notes by looking for note onsets and pitches.
Consecutive events are segmented using onset detection, while a fundamental
frequency extraction algorithm determines their pitch.
.PP
When started with an input \fIsource\fP (\fB-i\fP/\fB--input\fP), the detected notes are
printed on standard output, in seconds and midi note number.
.PP
When started without an input \fIsource\fP, or with the jack option (\fB-j\fP/\fB--jack\fP),
\fBaubionotes\fP starts in jack mode.
.SH OPTIONS

This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP, \fB--input\fP \fIsource\fP
Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP, \fB--samplerate\fP \fIrate\fP
Fetch the input \fIsource\fP, resampled at the given
sampling \fIrate\fP. The \fIrate\fP should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
the sampling \fIrate\fP of the original \fIsource\fP will be used. Defaults to 0.
.TP
.B
\fB-B\fP, \fB--bufsize\fP \fIwin\fP
The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.
.TP
.B
\fB-H\fP, \fB--hopsize\fP \fIhop\fP
The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
Defaults to 256.
.TP
.B
\fB-O\fP, \fB--onset\fP \fImethod\fP
The onset detection \fImethod\fP to use. See ONSET METHODS
below. Defaults to 'default'.
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP, \fB--onset-threshold\fP \fIthres\fP
Set the threshold value for the onset peak
picking. Typical values are typically within 0.001 and 0.900. Defaults to
0.1. Lower threshold values imply more onsets detected. Try 0.5 in case of
over-detections. Defaults to 0.3.
.TP
.B
\fB-M\fP, \fB--minioi\fP value
Set the minimum inter-onset interval, in seconds, the
shortest interval between two consecutive notes. Defaults to 0.030
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP, \fB--pitch\fP \fImethod\fP
The pitch detection \fImethod\fP to use. See PITCH METHODS
below. Defaults to 'default'.
.TP
.B
\fB-u\fP, \fB--pitch\fP-\fIunit\fP \fIunit\fP
The \fIunit\fP to be used to print frequencies. Possible
values include midi, bin, cent, and Hz. Defaults to 'Hz'.
.TP
.B
\fB-l\fP, \fB--pitch-tolerance\fP \fIthres\fP
Set the tolerance for the pitch detection
algorithm. Typical values range between 0.2 and 0.9. Pitch candidates found
with a confidence less than this threshold will not be selected. The higher
the threshold, the more confidence in the candidates. Defaults to unset.
.TP
.B
\fB-s\fP, \fB--silence\fP \fIsil\fP
Set the silence threshold, in dB, under which the pitch
will not be detected. A value of \fB-20.0\fP would eliminate most onsets but the
loudest ones. A value of \fB-90.0\fP would select all onsets. Defaults to \fB-90.0\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP, \fB--release\fP-\fIdrop\fP
Set the release \fIdrop\fP threshold, in dB. If the level drops
more than this amount since the last note started, the note will be turned
off. Defaults to 10.
.TP
.B
\fB-T\fP, \fB--timeformat\fP format
Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
seconds.
.TP
.B
\fB-j\fP, \fB--jack\fP
Use Jack input/output. You will need a Jack connection
controller to feed aubio some signal and listen to its output.
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP
Print a short help message and exit.
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP
Be verbose.
