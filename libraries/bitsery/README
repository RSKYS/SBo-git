Header only C++ binary serialization library. It is designed around the
networking requirements for real-time data delivery, especially for
games. All cross-platform requirements are enforced at compile time, so
serialized data do not store any meta-data information and is as small
as possible.

Features

 * Cross-platform compatible.
 * Optimized for speed and space.
 * No code generation required: no IDL or metadata, just use your
   types directly.
 * Configurable runtime error checking on deserialization.
 * Can read/write from any source: stream (file, network stream.
   etc... ), or buffer (vector, c-array, etc...).
 * Don't pay for what you don't use! - customize your serialization via
   extensions. Some notable extensions allow:
     *  fine-grained bit-level serialization control.
     *  forward/backward compatibility for your types.
     *  smart and raw pointers with allocators support and customizable
        runtime polymorphism.
 * Easily extendable for any type.
 * Allows brief (similar to cereal) or/and verbose syntax for better
   serialization control.
 * Configurable endianness support.
 * No macros.
