# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

blas: blas (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
blas:
blas: The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
blas: standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix
blas: operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector, and vector-vector
blas: operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the
blas: Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are
blas: efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used in
blas: the development of high quality linear algebra software.
