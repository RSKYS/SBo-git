  BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating 
high-performance BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. 
The framework was designed to isolate essential kernels of computation 
that, when optimized, immediately enable optimized implementations of 
most of its commonly used and computationally intensive operations. 
BLIS is written in ISO C99 and available under a new/modified/3-clause 
BSD license. While BLIS exports a new BLAS-like API, it also includes 
a BLAS compatibility layer which gives application developers access 
to BLIS implementations via traditional BLAS routine calls. 
An object-based API unique to BLIS is also available.
