# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

blis:   BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating 
blis: high-performance BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. 
blis: The framework was designed to isolate essential kernels of 
blis: computation that, when optimized, immediately enable optimized 
blis: implementations of most of its commonly used and computationally 
blis: intensive operations. BLIS is written in ISO C99 and available 
blis: under a new/modified/3-clause BSD license.
