# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bluez-alsa: bluez-alsa (Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend)
bluez-alsa:
bluez-alsa: Bluetooth audio alsa backend, which removesPulseAudio as a
bluez-alsa: dependency in Bluez >=5. BlueALSA registers all known Bluetooth
bluez-alsa: audio profiles in Bluez, so in theory every Bluetooth device (with
bluez-alsa: audio capabilities) can be connected. In order to access the audio
bluez-alsa: stream, one has to connect to the ALSA PCM device called bluealsa.
