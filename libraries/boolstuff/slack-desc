# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

boolstuff: boolean expression binary trees. The main features are:
boolstuff: - a boolean expression parser (supports operators AND, OR
boolstuff: and NOT, as well as parentheses);
boolstuff: - an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree
boolstuff: into its Disjunctive Normal Form;
