# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bwidget: bwidget (A suite of megawidgets for Tk)
bwidget:
bwidget: The BWidget Toolkit is a high-level Widget Set for Tcl/Tk
bwidget: built using native Tcl/Tk 8.x namespaces. The BWidgets have a
bwidget: professional look and feel as in other well known Toolkits
bwidget: (Tix or IncrWidgets), but the concept is radically different
bwidget: because everything is pure Tcl/Tk. No platform dependencies,
bwidget: and no compiling required. The code is 100% Pure Tcl/Tk.
