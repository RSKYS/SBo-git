# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cln: cln (class library for numbers)
cln:
cln: CLN is a library for computations with all kinds of numbers. It has a
cln: rich set of number classes, including integers (with unlimited
cln: precision), reals with various precisions (including unlimited),
cln: rationals, complex numbers and polynomials. The kernel is written in
cln: assembly language. It uses garbage collection (automatic, without
cln: imposing any burden on the main application). Many efficient
cln: algorithms (i.e. for all transcendental functions) are implemented.
