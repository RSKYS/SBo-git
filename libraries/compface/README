Compface converts 48x48x1 images to and from a compressed format.
The purpose is to allow the inclusion of face images within mail 
headers using the field name 'X-face:'. It uses the library that
can be used to allow the compression and decompression algorithms
to be used in other programs such as mail dispatchers and mail
notification daemons.
