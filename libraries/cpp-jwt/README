JSON Web Token library for C++

For the uninitiated, JSON Web Token(JWT) is a JSON based standard
(RFC-7519) for creating assertions or access tokens that consists of
some claims (encoded within the assertion). This assertion can be used
in some kind of bearer authentication mechanism that the server will
provide to clients, and the clients can make use of the provided
assertion for accessing resources.
