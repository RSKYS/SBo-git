db4 (Berkeley database library version 4.6.x)

The Berkeley Database (Berkeley DB) library provides embedded database
support for both traditional and client/server applications.

This package should be installed if compatibility is needed with
databases created with the Berkeley DB version 4.6.x.

Note that the resulting package will overwrite some symlinks included
in Slackware's db44 package; this shouldn't cause any problems, but
in case you remove this package for whatever reason, you'll need to
reinstall db44, and anything that linked db46 will no longer work.
