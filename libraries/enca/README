Enca detects the encoding of text files, on the basis of knowledge of
their language. It can also convert them to other encodings, allowing
you to recode files without knowing their current encoding. It supports
most of Central and East European languages, and a few Unicode variants,
independently on language.

Optional dependencies: recode, perl-Cstools, perl-Unicode-Map and
perl-Unicode-Map8
