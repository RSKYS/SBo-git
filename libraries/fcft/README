fcft is a small font loading and glyph rasterization library built
on-top of FontConfig, FreeType2 and pixman.
It can load and cache fonts from a fontconfig-formatted name string,
 e.g. Monospace:size=12, optionally with user configured fallback fonts.

After a font has been loaded, you can rasterize glyphs. When doing so,
the primary font is first considered. If it does not have the requested
glyph, the user configured fallback fonts (if any) are considered.
If none of the user configured fallback fonts has the requested glyph,
the FontConfig generated list of fallback fonts are checked.
The API is documented as man pages.
Starting with 2.3.0, fcft gained the ability to do text shaping using
HarfBuzz (an optional dependency). Initially, only individual grapheme
clusters could be shaped. With 2.4.0, the ability to shape whole
text-runs were added. It should be noted however, that fcft does
not aim to compete with e.g. Pango, and that the text shaping support
may not be (and perhaps never will be) sufficient for “professional”
text layout.

if you have to rebuild the package delete /tmp/SBo/fcft directory.
