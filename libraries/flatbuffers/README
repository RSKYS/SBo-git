FlatBuffers is a cross platform serialization library architected for
maximum memory efficiency. It allows you to directly access serialized
data without parsing/unpacking it first, while still having great
forwards/backwards compatibility.

Why use FlatBuffers?
  * Access to serialized data without parsing/unpacking
  * Memory efficiency and speed
  * Flexible
  * Tiny code footprint
  * Strongly typed
  * Convenient to use
  * Cross platform code with no dependencies

Why not use Protocol Buffers, or .. ?
Protocol Buffers is indeed relatively similar to FlatBuffers, with the
primary difference being that FlatBuffers does not need a parsing/
unpacking step to a secondary representation before you can access
data, often coupled with per-object memory allocation. The code is an
order of magnitude bigger, too. Protocol Buffers has no optional text
import/export.
