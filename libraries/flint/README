FLINT (Fast Library for Number Theory) is a C library in support of
computations in number theory. It's also a research project into
algorithms in number theory.

FLINT supports arithmetic with numbers, polynomials, power series and
matrices over many base rings, including:
 * Multiprecision integers and rationals
 * Integers modulo n
 * p-adic numbers
 * Finite fields (prime and non-prime order)
 * Real and complex numbers (via the Arb extension library)

FLINT was licensed GPL v2+ up to and including version 2.5. New version
are licensed LGPL v2.1+.
