Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a
library of C++11 components designed with practicality and efficiency
in mind. Folly contains a variety of core library components used
extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of
Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where those
projects can share code.
