Utilities for handling IEEE 754 floating point special values.
This python module implements constants and functions for working with
IEEE754 double-precision special values.  It provides constants for
Not-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (PosInf), and Negative Infinity
(NegInf), as well as functions to test for these values.
