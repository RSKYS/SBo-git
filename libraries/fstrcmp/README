The fstrcmp project provides a library that is used to make fuzzy
comparisons of strings and byte arrays, including multi-byte character
strings.

This can be useful in error messages, enabling the suggestion of likely
valid alternatives. In compilers, this can reduce the cascade of
secondary errors.
