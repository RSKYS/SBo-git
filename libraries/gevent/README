Gevent is a coroutine-based Python networking library that uses greenlet
to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of the libev event loop.

Features include:
 - Fast event loop based on libev (epoll on Linux, kqueue on FreeBSD).
 - Lightweight execution units based on greenlet.
 - API that re-uses concepts from the Python standard library
   (for example there are Events and Queues).
 - Cooperative sockets with SSL support.
 - DNS queries performed through threadpool or c-ares.
 - Monkey patching utility to get 3rd party modules to become
   cooperative
