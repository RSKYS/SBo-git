gf2x is a C/C++ software package containing routines for fast
arithmetic in GF(2)[x] (multiplication, squaring, GCD) and searching
for irreducible/primitive trinomials.

gf2x requires a CPU with SSE2 support. All x86_64 CPUs are OK, and
most 32-bit x86 CPUs still in use in 2022 are OK. If in doubt, run
e.g. "grep sse2 /proc/cpuinfo" to find out.
