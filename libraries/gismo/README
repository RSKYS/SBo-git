  G+Smo (pronounced gismo or gizmo) is a C++ library for isogeometric
analysis (IGA). Geometry plus simulation modules aims at the seamless
integration of Computer-aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element
Analysis (FEA). 

  G+Smo (Geometry + Simulation Modules, pronounced "gismo") is an
open-source C++ library that brings together mathematical tools for
geometric design and numerical simulation. It implements the
relatively new paradigm of isogeometric analysis, which suggests the
use of a unified framework in the design and analysis pipeline. G+Smo
is an object-oriented, cross-platform, template C++ library and
follows the generic programming principle, with a focus on both
efficiency and ease of use. The library aims at providing access to
high quality, open-source software to the forming isogeometric
numerical simulation community and beyond.


Optional building modes set with environment variables:
 - QTAPP=yes : build the QT application
 - OMP=yes : building with OpenMP
 - MPI=yes : build with MPI support (requires mpich or openmpi)
 - HYBRID=yes : OpenMP+MPI (requires mpich or openmpi)
 - VTK=yes : use VTK, requires VTK package.
