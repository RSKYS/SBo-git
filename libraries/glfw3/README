GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and
Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating
windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.

GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, macOS and many
Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.

GLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.

This is version 3 of GLFW with an incompatible API to GLFW 2.
