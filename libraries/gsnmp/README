GSNMP an SNMP library written on top of glib and gnet.

The goal of the project is to provide an efficient, clean, portable
implementation of an SNMP stack for management applications.

GSNMP was written by Juergen Schoenwaelder , though some parts of this
package contain code originally written by Gregory McLean,
Jochen Friedrich and Dirk Wisse.
