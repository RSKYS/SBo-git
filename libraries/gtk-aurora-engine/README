Aurora GTK Engine
 
The Aurora Gtk Engine themes all common Gtk widgets to provide an 
attractive, complete and consistent look for Gtk applications.
   
By default, this SlackBuild builds aurora with animation support.
If you don't want animations, launch the script as:
# ANIM=NO ./gtk-aurora-engine.SlackBuild
