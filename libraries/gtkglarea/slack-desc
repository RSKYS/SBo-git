# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gtkglarea: gtkglarea (OpenGL widget for GTK+)
gtkglarea:
gtkglarea: GtkGLArea is an OpenGL widget for GTK+ GUI toolkit.
gtkglarea: Just as GTK+ is built on top of GDK, GtkGLArea is built on top of
gtkglarea: gdkgl which is basically a wrapper around GLX functions.  The
gtkglarea: widget itself is very similar to the GtkDrawingArea widget and
gtkglarea: adds only three extra functions.  Lower level gdkgl functions
gtkglarea: make it easy to render on any OpenGL capable widget; rendering
gtkglarea: to off-screen pixmaps is also supported.
