gtkhtml is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine

GtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.  It
was originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is now
being developed independently.

GtkHTML is currently maintained by the Evolution team and no longer
has its own mailing list.  The best place to ask GtkHTML questions
is on the "evolution-hackers" mailing list.
