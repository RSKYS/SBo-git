  HPTT is a high-performance C++ library for out-of-place tensor
transpositions.

  Key features:

  - Multi-threading support
  - Explicit vectorization
  - Auto-tuning (akin to FFTW)
    - Loop order
    - Parallelization
  - Multi architecture support
    - Explicitly vectorized kernels for (AVX and ARM)
  -  Supports float, double, complex and double complex data types
  -  Supports both column-major and row-major data layouts


  By default it builds a scalar version, if you want to change it.
Set the environment variable to AVX=yes or ARM=yes (arm only).
  If you want to install the Python API set PYTHON=yes.
