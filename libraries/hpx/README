HPX is a C++ Standards Library for Concurrency and Parallelism. It
implements all of the corresponding facilities as defined by the
C++ Standard. Additionally, in HPX we implement functionalities
proposed as part of the ongoing C++ standardization process. We also
extend the C++ Standard APIs to the distributed case.

The goal of HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open
source implementation of a new programming model for conventional
systems, such as classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket
highly parallel SMP nodes. At the same time, we want to have a very
modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would
allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system
architectures. We want to use real world applications to drive the
development of the runtime system, coining out required
functionalities and converging onto a stable API which will provide
a smooth migration path for developers.

The API exposed by HPX is not only modelled after the interfaces
defined by the C++11/14 ISO standard, it also adheres to the
programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries.
We aim improve the scalability of today's applications and to expose
new levels of parallelism which are necessary to take advantage of
the exascale systems of the future.
