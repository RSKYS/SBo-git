Prior to the introduction of HTSlib, SAMtools and BCFtools were
distributed in a single samtools-0.1.x package. This old version remains
available from SBo as samtools-legacy.

HTSlib has been distributed as a separate package to facilitate the
writing of programs against the HTSlib API. HTSlib also provides the
bgzip, htsfile, and tabix utilities, so the installation of HTSlib
provides these utilities as well.
