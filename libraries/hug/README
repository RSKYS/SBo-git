The Highlevel Universal GUI abstraction layer (HUG) is a simple set
of functions to allow BaCon setting up graphical user interfaces in
a fast and efficient manner.

See README.SLACKWARE in the docs directory for details on how to use HUG.

Note: When a new version of HUG is released, the downloads will
change and the md5sums won't match.
