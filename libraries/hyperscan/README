hyperscan (A high-performance multiple regex matching library)

Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library. It
follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used PCRE library,
yet functions as a standalone library with its own API written in C.

Hyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching
of large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions, as
well as matching of regular expressions across streams of data.
