  HYPRE is a library of high performance preconditioners and solvers
featuring multigrid methods for the solution of large, sparse linear
systems of equations on massively parallel computers.

  Buildind options that can be set using the environment variables:
  - OMP=yes, to build with openmp support
  - MPI=yes, to build with MPI support, requires mpich or openmpi
  - CUDA=yes, to enable CUDA, requires CUDA sdk > 8.0
