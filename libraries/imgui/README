Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++.
It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in
your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer
agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).

Dear ImGui is designed to enable fast iterations and to empower
programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug
tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors
simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and lacks certain
features normally found in more high-level libraries.

Dear ImGui is particularly suited to integration in games engine (for
tooling), real-time 3D applications, fullscreen applications, embedded
applications, or any applications on consoles platforms where
operating system features are non-standard.

  * Minimize state synchronization.
  * Minimize state storage on user side.
  * Minimize setup and maintenance.
  * Easy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.
  * Easy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived,
    more elaborate tools.
  * Easy to hack and improve.
  * Portable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones,
    etc.).
  * Efficient runtime and memory consumption.
  * Battle-tested, used by many major actors in the game industry.
