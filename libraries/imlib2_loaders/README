imlib2_loaders (xcf image loader for imlib2)

This package contains image loader plugins for Imlib 2 that are not
distributed together with the Imlib 2 package itself, for licensing
reasons. Currently, the only plugin is for XCF, which is the Gimp's
native file format.

Note: the version number of this build should match the version number
of imlib2. If you find that this is not the case, please contact the
maintainer so I can update this.

Note: if you're trying to add .xcf file support to qiv, this package
won't help. Install xcf-pixbuf-loader instead.
