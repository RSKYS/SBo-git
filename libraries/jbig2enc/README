jbig2enc (encoder for JBIG2)

JBIG2 encodes bi-level (1 bpp) images using a number of clever tricks
to get better compression than G4.

The package includes shared libraries, headers, docs, the jbig2(1)
command-line conversion tool, and pdf.py(1) which post-processes JBIG2
files to create PDFs.

Use of this software may require patent licenses in some countries.
You are directed to annex I of the JBIG2 specification for information.
