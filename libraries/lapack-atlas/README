LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.

This script just installs the LAPACK sources such that the atlas.SlackBuild
can find them (with its default settings) and build a full LAPACK
library linked to its optimized BLAS routines. As such nothing gets
build yet.
