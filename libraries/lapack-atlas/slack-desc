# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lapack-atlas: lapack-atlas (LAPACK sources for build against ATLAS)
lapack-atlas:
lapack-atlas: LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
lapack-atlas: equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
lapack-atlas: eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated
lapack-atlas: matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized
lapack-atlas: Schur) are also provided, as are related computations such as
lapack-atlas: reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition
lapack-atlas: numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general sparse
lapack-atlas: matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided for real and
lapack-atlas: complex matrices, in both single and double precision.
