# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lapack: lapack (linear algebra routines)
lapack:
lapack: LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
lapack: equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
lapack: eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated
lapack: matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized
lapack: Schur) are also provided, as are related computations such as
lapack: reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition
lapack: numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general
lapack: sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided
lapack: for real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.
