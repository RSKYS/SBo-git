popular image formats are supported using standard libraries, with
XCF, XPM, PPM/PNM, BMP, ICO, TGA, and GIF being supported internally.
PNG, JPEG, and TIFF formats are supported via standard libraries.
For convenience, source for libJPEG and libPNG is supplied with

providing support for TrueType fonts using the FreeType library
and antialiasing of standard fonts from the X window system.
