  libROM is a free, lightweight, scalable C++ library for data-driven
physical simulation methods. It is the main tool box that the reduced
order modeling team at LLNL uses to develop efficient model order
reduction techniques and physics-constrained data-driven methods. We
try to collect any useful reduced order model routines, which are
separable to the high-fidelity physics solvers, into libROM. Plus,
libROM is open source, so anyone is welcome to suggest new ideas or
contribute to the development. Let's work together for better
data-driven technology!


  If you want to use MFEM set MFEM=yes, this requires the hypre, metis,
parmetis and mfem package.
