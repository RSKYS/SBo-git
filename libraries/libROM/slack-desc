# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libROM:   libROM is a free, lightweight, scalable C++ library for data-driven
libROM: physical simulation methods. It is the main tool box that the reduced
libROM: order modeling team at LLNL uses to develop efficient model order
libROM: reduction techniques and physics-constrained data-driven methods. We
libROM: try to collect any useful reduced order model routines, which are
libROM: separable to the high-fidelity physics solvers, into libROM.
