# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libXCFun:   XCFun is a library of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals to be
libXCFun: used in density-functional theory (DFT) codes. XCFun follows a unique
libXCFun: implementation strategy which enables the computation of derivatives
libXCFun: of the XC functional kernel up to arbitrary order. It does so by
libXCFun: relying on forward-mode automatic differentiation.
