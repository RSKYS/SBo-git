libaaio is a software library providing the functionality of getch(),
getche() and kbhit() on Linux and UNIX systems (including Mac OS
X). It does not require an initialization (like curses) and does not
abuse the terminal (i.e.  whenever the mode of the terminal is changed
its state is stored so it can be restored).

The software has not seen any changes since 2005, but remains useful
primarily for initial porting of Win32 terminal programs.  This build
installs both the static and shared libraries, as most programs using
this library expect the former.
