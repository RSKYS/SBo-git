# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libaec: libaec (Adaptive Entropy Coding library)
libaec:
libaec: Libaec provides fast lossless compression of 1 up to 32 bit wide
libaec: signed or unsigned integers (samples). The library achieves best
libaec: results for low entropy data as often encountered in space imaging
libaec: instrument data or numerical model output from weather or climate
libaec: simulations. While floating point representations are not directly
libaec: supported, they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents
libaec: and mantissa. 
libaec:
libaec: Libaec can replace SZIP.
