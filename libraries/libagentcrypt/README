The libagentcrypt library allows using the keys in the SSH Agent to
perform symmetric, authenticated encryption and decryption securely
without typing passwords. It works with both RSA and ED25519 SSH keys
including those made available to a remote host by SSH Agent forwarding.

A command line encryption utility 'agentcrypt' is provided.
