# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libast: libast (Library of Assorted Spiffy Things)
libast:
libast: LibAST is the Library of Assorted Spiffy Things.  It contains many
libast: spiffy things, and it is a library.  Thus, the ever-so-creative name.
libast: LibAST has been previously known as libmej, the Eterm helper library
libast: which nobody really understood and certainly never used.  My current
libast: plan is to gradually remove some of the neat stuff from Eterm that
libast: could be made generic (things like the theme parsing engine, the
libast: command-line options parser, perhaps the event engine, ...) and place
libast: it here in the hopes that others will find them useful.
