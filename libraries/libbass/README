BASS is an audio library for use in software on several platforms.
Its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient
sample, stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF, custom generated, and
more via OS codecs and add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM,
UMX), MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs), and recording functions.
All in a compact .SO that won't bloat your distribution.
