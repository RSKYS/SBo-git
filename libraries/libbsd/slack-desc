# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libbsd: libbsd (library of BSD functions)
libbsd:
libbsd: This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems,
libbsd: and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port
libbsd: projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same
libbsd: code over and over again on each project.
