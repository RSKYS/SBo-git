libctl (flexible control of scientific simulations)

libctl is a Guile (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) based library 
for supporting flexible control in files in scientific simulations. 
It is used by the scheme-based interface to the electromagnetic 
simulation software programs MPB and MEEP.

Configuration:

The configure options "enable-shared" and "disable-static" are built 
into this slackbuild script.  You can add additional options to the 
command line using the environment variable SBOPTIONS_LIBCTL; e.g. to 
install to a chosen location use e.g.:

SBOPTIONS_LIBCTL="--prefix=/usr/local" ./libctl.Slackbuild

Alternatively, if building non-interactively (e.g. if using slpkg), 
use/create  the file /etc/sbo_pkg_options.conf since this slackbuild 
script will search it for options instead of using SBOPTIONS_LIBCTL. 
Simply include a line starting "libctl:" followed by options, e.g.:

libctl: --prefix=/usr/local
