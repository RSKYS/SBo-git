DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit) is a collaborative,
cross-platform, open source library created by the Graphics Lab and
Humanoid Robotics Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology with ongoing
contributions from the Personal Robotics Lab at University of
Washington and Open Source Robotics Foundation. The library provides
data structures and algorithms for kinematic and dynamic applications
in robotics and computer animation.
