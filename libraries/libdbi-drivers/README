The libdbi-drivers project maintains drivers for the libdbi database
abstraction layer written in C. Drivers are distributed separately
from the library itself.

This includes the drivers for mysql and sqlite by default. 
If the optional dependecy postgresql is installed and the
PGSQL="true" variable is set, then driver for it will be built
as well.
