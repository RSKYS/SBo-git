libdbi - Database Independent Abstraction Layer for C

libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set
of code, programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases
and multiple simultaneous database connections by using this framework.

In order to utilize the libdbi framework, you need to install drivers
for a particular type of database. The drivers officially supported
by libdbi are split off into the libdbi-drivers project.
