libde265 is an open source implementation of the h.265 video codec. It
is written from scratch and has a plain C API to enable a simple
integration into other software.

By default, sherlock265 visual inspection program is not built.

Building of sherlock265 can be enabled by setting the SHERLOCK265
environment variable to "yes": SHERLOCK265=yes ./libde265.SlackBuild
This requires ffmpeg or ffmpeg4. If qt5 is installed sherlock265 will be
built with qt5 instead of qt4.
