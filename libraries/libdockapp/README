libdockapp (library for developing WindowMaker dockapps)

libDockApp is a library that provides a framework for developing
dockapps. It provides functions and structures to define and display
command-line options, create a dockable icon, handle events, etc.

The goal of the library is to provide a simple, yet clean interface and
standardize the ways in which dockapps are developed. A dockapp
developed using libDockApp will automatically behave well under most
window managers, and especially well under WindowMaker.
