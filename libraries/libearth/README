The shared common library for Earth Reader apps.

Libearth is the shared common library for various Earth Reader apps.
Earth Reader try to support many platforms as possible  (e.g. web,
mobile apps, desktop apps), so there must be a large part of common
concepts and implementations they share like subscription lists,
synchronization through cloud storages between several devices,
and crawler, that libearth actually implements.
