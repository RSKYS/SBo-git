libepubgen is a library for generating documents in EPUB format,
implementing librevenge document interfaces. It supports conversion
of text documents, presentations and vector drawings. Spreadsheets
are not supported. As these interfaces are used by multiple libraries,
libepubgen can be used to generate EPUB from many sources.

To build the tests, install cppunit before running this script.

To build the doxygen html documentation use:
  DOC="yes" ./libepubgen.SlackBuild
