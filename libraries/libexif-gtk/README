Libexif-gtk (provides GTK+ widgets to display/edit EXIF tags)

Most digital cameras produce EXIF files, which are JPEG files with 
extra tags that contain information about the image. The EXIF library
allows you to parse an EXIF file and read the data from those tags.

This library provides GTK+ widgets to display/edit EXIF tags.
