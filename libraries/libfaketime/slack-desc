# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libfaketime:
libfaketime: libfaketime intercepts various system calls which programs use to
libfaketime: retrieve the current date and time. It can then report faked dates
libfaketime: and times (as specified by you, the user) to these programs. This
libfaketime: means you can modify the system time a program sees without having to
libfaketime: change the time system-wide.
