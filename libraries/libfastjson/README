libfastjson is a fork from json-c, which is optimized for
liblognorm processing.

The aim of this project is not to provide a slightly modified clone
of json-c. Its aim is to provide a small library with essential
json handling functions, sufficiently good json support (not 100%
standards compliant), and be very fast in processing.
