# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libfastjson: liblognorm processing.
libfastjson:
libfastjson: The aim of this project is not to provide a slightly modified clone
libfastjson: of json-c. Its aim is to provide a small library with essential
libfastjson: json handling functions, sufficiently good json support (not 100%
libfastjson: standards compliant), and be very fast in processing.
