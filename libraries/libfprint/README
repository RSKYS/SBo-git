libfprint is the center of our efforts. libfprint is the component 
which does the dirty work of talking to fingerprint reading devices, 
and processing fingerprint data.

If you're a user, you probably aren't interested in libfprint, 
instead you want to find some software which uses libfprint 
(see the integration project).

If you're an application developer looking to add support for some 
kind of fingerprinting to your software, libfprint is exactly what 
you are looking for. It provides a simple API for you to enroll 
fingerprints and then identify users later on.
