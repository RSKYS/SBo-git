Libgaminggear provides functions and widgets common for gaming input
devices.

For input events to work for users (needed for software macros and such)
they need access rights for uinput or uhid. To use them as normal user
you should create an extra group. The default is uinput-users but you 
can specify a different group before running the script:

GROUP="groupname" ./libgaminggear.SlackBuild

You will need to create the group

    # groupadd -r -g 317 $GROUP

and add all needed users to this group

    # usermod -a -G $GROUP $USER
