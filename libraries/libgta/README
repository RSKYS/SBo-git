The GTA project provides a file format called Generic Tagged Arrays that
-  is very easy to use
-  can store any kind of multidimensional array data
-  allows generic manipulations of array data
-  allows conversion to and from other file formats

This libgta package is an optional requirement for OpenSceneGraph.
