# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libhid: libhid (libhid is a rewrite of libHID[0])
libhid:
libhid: libhid is a rewrite of libHID[0] and aims to provide the same
libhid: functionality from a more organised framework. It aims to provide a
libhid: layer of abstraction for accessing HID-class devices over USB or
libhid: serial lines (similar to what libusb provides for the base USB
libhid: protocol).
