The Hoard memory allocator is a fast, scalable, and memory-efficient
memory allocator. It runs on a variety of platforms, including Linux,
Solaris, and Windows. Hoard is a drop-in replacement for malloc()
that can dramatically improve application performance, especially for
multithreaded programs running on multiprocessors.
