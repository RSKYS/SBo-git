# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libiec61883: libiec61883 (implementation of IEC 61883, part 1)
libiec61883:
libiec61883: This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP,
libiec61883: plug registers, and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS),
libiec61883: and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all FireWire
libiec61883: multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.
libiec61883: The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for
libiec61883: streaming DV, MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This
libiec61883: includes both reception and transmission. It uses the new
libiec61883: "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which transparently provides
libiec61883: mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer.
