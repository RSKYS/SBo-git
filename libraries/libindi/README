INDI is a distributed control protocol designed to operate
astronomical instrumentation. INDI is small, flexible, easy to parse,
and scalable.  It supports common DCS functions such as remote
control, data acquisition, monitoring, and a lot more.

This script builds the library that KDE KStars and similar programs
can use for image capture in astrophotography, telescope control, etc.

rtl-sdr is optional to enable Realtek RTL2832 DVB dongle as a SDR
receiver (available on SBo). There may be additional optional 
dependencies.

Supported hardware devices: http://indilib.org/devices/
You will need libindi-drivers (also on SBo) to fully utilize some
third party hardware. Refer to indi-{libraries,drivers} on SBo for
optional hardware requirements and dependencies.
