libkqueue (portable userspace implementation of kqueue(2))

libkqueue is a portable userspace implementation of the kqueue(2)
kernel event notification mechanism. It acts as a translator
between the kevent structure and the native kernel facilities of
the host machine.

This library is necessary for the Darling project to compile
correctly.
