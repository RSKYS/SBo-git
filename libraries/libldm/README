libldm is a tool and library for
managing Microsoft Windows Dynamic Disks.
which use Microsoft's LDM metadata. It can inspect them
and also create and remove device-mapper block devices
which can be mounted.

Although a filesystem can be mounted read-write
and its contents modified, ldmtool is not able to
modify the LDM metadata itself. That is, it cannot
create, remove or edit dynamic disks.

It is also not able to mount RAID5 volumes which
have a partition missing, although it can mount mirrored
volumes with a partition missing. However,
mounting a volume with a missing partition is not recommended,
as ldmtool does not update the LDM metadata in any way.
This means Windows will have no way to determine that the partitions
are not synchronised when it subsequently mounted,
which may result in corruption.
