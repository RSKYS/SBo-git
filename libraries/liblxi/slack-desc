# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

liblxi: liblxi (support library for LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation)
liblxi:
liblxi: liblxi is an open source software library which offers a simple API
liblxi: for communicating with LXI compatible instruments. The API allows
liblxi: applications to discover instruments on your network, send SCPI
liblxi: commands, and receive responses.
liblxi:
liblxi: Currently the library supports VXI-11/TCP and RAW/TCP connections.
liblxi: Future work include adding support for the newer and more efficient
liblxi: HiSlip protocol which is used by next generation LXI instruments.
