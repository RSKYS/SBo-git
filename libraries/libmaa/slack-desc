# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libmaa: libmaa (general purpose data structures and functions)
libmaa:
libmaa: The LIBMAA library provides many low-level data structures which
libmaa: are helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets,
libmaa: lists, debugging support, and memory management.  Although LIBMAA
libmaa: was designed and implemented as a foundation for the Khepera
libmaa: Transformation System, the data structures are generally applicable
libmaa: to a wide range of programming problems.  The memory management
libmaa: routines are especially helpful for improving the performance of
libmaa: memory-intensive applications.
