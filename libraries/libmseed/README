libmseed (C library framework for manipulating SEED data records)

The Mini-SEED library provides a framework for manipulation of SEED
data records including the unpacking and packing of data records.
Functionality is also included for managing waveform data as continuous
traces.

The library should work in Linux, BSD (and derivatives like macOS),
Solaris and Win32 environments.
