libnbcompat (a portable NetBSD compat library)

libnbcompat is a portable NetBSD-compatibility library that supplies
routines used by NetBSD bootstrap tools that are missing on other
operating systems.

By default, the static library is not included. If you need it, feel
free to pass STATIC=yes to the build script.
