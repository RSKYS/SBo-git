libopenglrecorder (audio/video opengl recording library)

libopenglrecorder is a library allowing optional async readback OpenGL
frame buffer with optional audio recording. It will do video and audio

This has an optional dependency of OpenH264 (not x264) to enable
h264 encoding. This is not currently available on SBo.
