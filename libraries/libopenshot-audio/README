OpenShot Audio Library (libopenshot-audio) is a library that allows the 
high-quality editing and playback of audio, and is based on the amazing 
JUCE library.

By default, the API documentation is not built, as it's rather
resource-intensive, and not required unless you're a developer. If
you need the API docs, install graphviz, then run this build with
APIDOC=yes in the environment.
