libpgf is a new image file format, based on discrete, fast wavelet 
transform with progressive coding features that provides lossless 
and lossy compression.

It's considered as one of the best algorithms available these days 
for compression of natural images

NOTE: dos2unix is a build-time dependency, not a runtime dependency
