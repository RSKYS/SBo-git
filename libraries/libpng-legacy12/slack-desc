# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libpng-legacy12: This build provides libpng12.so, occasionally needed for running
libpng-legacy12: older binary-only software. It can safely be installed without
libpng-legacy12: conflicting with Slackware's own libpng (which is version 1.6).
