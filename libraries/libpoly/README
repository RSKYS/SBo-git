  LibPoly is a C library for manipulating polynomials. The target
applications are symbolic reasoning engines, such as SMT solvers,
that need to reason about polynomial constraints. It is research
software under development, so the features and the API might
change rapidly.


  If you want to build the python API, set PYTHON=yes to the
environment variables. By default it uses python2, if you want to
use python3 set PYTHON3=yes.
