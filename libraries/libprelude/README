Prelude Library Overview
========================

The Prelude Library is used to make sensor developers' life better by
providing features used by every sensor:

    - Manager(s) Connection management (with fallback in case all
      configured Managers are down, and automatic reconnection).

    - Interface to communicate with the Prelude Manager.

    - Asynchronous Message interface (allowing sensor to emit message
      without blocking, even if there is latency on the wire).

    - Asynchronous timer interface.

    - Generic configuration API, providing a generic abstraction for
      command-line, configuration file option, and wide option support.

    - Wide option managment allowing sensor-exported options to be
      directly accessible from the Manager administrative console.

    - Generic plugin API.
