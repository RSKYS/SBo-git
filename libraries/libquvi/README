The quvi project parses media stream URLs for Internet applications 
that would otherwise have to use adobe flash multimedia platform to 
access the media streams. quvi project works around the adobe flash, 
rather than enables it.

NOTE: You have to remove any previous version you have already
installed of libquvi before building this.
