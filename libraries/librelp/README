librelp is an easy to use library for the RELP protocol.
RELP in turn provides reliable event logging over the network
(and consequently RELP stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol).
RELP was initiated by Rainer Gerhards after he was finally upset by
the lossy nature of plain tcp syslog and wanted a cure for all these
dangling issues.
