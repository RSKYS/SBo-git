This library is based on the Turbo Vision library made by Borland
Corporation.  That library was released by Borland under a Public

Turbo Vision (TVision for short) is a TUI (Text User Interface) that
implements the well known CUA widgets. With TVision you can create an
intuitive text mode application, intuitive means it will have CUA
like interface (check boxes, radio buttons, push buttons, input lines,
pull-down menues, status bars, etc.). All the people accustomed to the
Windows, MacOS, OS/2, Motif, GTK, etc. interfaces will understand the
interface at first sight.
