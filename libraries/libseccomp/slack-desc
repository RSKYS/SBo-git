# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libseccomp: libseccomp (Enhanced seccomp library)
libseccomp:
libseccomp: The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform independent,
libseccomp: interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism. The
libseccomp: libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based
libseccomp: syscall filter language and present a more conventional function-call
libseccomp: based filtering interface that should be familiar to, and easily
libseccomp: adopted by, application developers.
