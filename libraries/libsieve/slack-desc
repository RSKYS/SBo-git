# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libsieve: libsieve (interpreter for Sieve scripts)
libsieve:
libsieve: libSieve provides a library to interpret Sieve scripts, and to
libsieve: execute those scripts over a given set of messages. The return codes
libsieve: from the libSieve functions let your program know how to handle the
libsieve: message, and then it's up to you to make it so. libSieve makes no
libsieve: attempt to have knowledge of how SMTP, IMAP, or anything else work;
libsieve: just how to parse and deal with a buffer full of emails. The rest is
libsieve: up to you!
