libtsm (terminal-emulator state machine)

TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal
emulators. It tries to support all common standards while keeping
compatibility to existing emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal,
konsole, ..

TSM itself does not provide any rendering nor window management. It is
a simple plain state machine without any external dependencies. It can
be used to implement terminal emulators, but also to implement other
applications that need to interpret terminal escape sequences.
