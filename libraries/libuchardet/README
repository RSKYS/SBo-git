libuchardet (encoding detector library)

uchardet uchardet is a C language binding of the original C++
implementation of the universal charset detection library by Mozilla.

uchardet is an encoding detector library, which takes a sequence of
bytes in an unknown character encoding without any additional
information, and attempts to determine the encoding of the text.
Returned encoding names are iconv-compatible.

It can now detect more charsets, and more reliably than the original
implementation.
