Libucl is a universal configuration library parser.
UCL is heavily infused by nginx configuration as the example of a
convenient configuration system.
However, UCL is fully compatible with JSON format and is able to parse
json files.
UCL has clear design that should be very convenient for reading and
writing. At the same time it is compatible with JSON language and
therefore can be used as a simple JSON parser. Macro logic provides an
ability to extend configuration language
(for example by including some lua code) and comments allow to disable
or enable the parts of a configuration quickly.
