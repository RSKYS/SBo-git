libunicap (video capture api)

unicap provides a uniform interface to video capture devices.  It allows
applications to use any supported video capture device via a single API.
It offers a high level of hardware abstraction while maintaining maximum
performance.  Zero copy capture of video buffers is possible for devices
supporting it allowing fast video capture with low CPU usage even on
low-speed architectures.

ffmpeg is an optional dependency.
