# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libvdwxc: libvdwxc (A library for vdW-DF exchange-correlation functionals)
libvdwxc:
libvdwxc:   libvdwxc is a general library for evaluating energy and potential
libvdwxc: for exchange-correlation (XC) functionals from the vdW-DF family 
libvdwxc: that can be used with various of density functional theory (DFT) 
libvdwxc: codes. This work was inspired by success of libXC, a library for 
libvdwxc: local and semilocal XC functionals. At the moment, libvdwxc provides 
libvdwxc: access to the DF1, DF2, and CX functionals and interfaces for GPAW 
libvdwxc: and Octopus. The library has been tested with respect to the S22 
libvdwxc: test set, various bulk properties of metals and semiconductors, 
libvdwxc: and surface energies.
