# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libxc: Libxc is a library of exchange-correlation and kinetic energy 
libxc: functionals for density-functional theory. The original aim was 
libxc: to provide a portable, well tested and reliable set of these 
libxc: functionals to be used by all the codes of the European 
libxc: Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF), but the library has
libxc: since grown to be used in several other types of codes as well.
