libxnvctrl (NVIDIA NV-CONTROL X extension)

The NV-CONTROL X extension provides a mechanism for X clients to query
and set configuration parameters of the NVIDIA X driver. State set by
the NV-CONTROL X extension is assumed to be persistent only for the
current server generation. This can be useful for programs such as
conky, mate-sensors-applet, and xfce4-sensors-plugin to allow for
realtime monitoring of your NVIDIA cards temperature, fan speed, memory,
etc.

This package is version independent.  It does not have to match
the nvidia-driver or nvidia-legacy packages.  I try to keep it
in line with SBO packages, however it is not required that this package
is the same version as the binary drivers.
