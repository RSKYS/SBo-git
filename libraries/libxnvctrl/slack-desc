# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libxnvctrl: libxnvctrl (NVIDIA NV-CONTROL X extension)
libxnvctrl:
libxnvctrl: The NV-CONTROL X extension provides a mechanism for X clients to
libxnvctrl: query and set configuration parameters of the NVIDIA X driver. State
libxnvctrl: set by the NV-CONTROL X extension is assumed to be persistent only
libxnvctrl: for the current server generation. This can be useful for programs
libxnvctrl: such as conky, mate-sensors-applet, and xfce4-sensors-plugin to
libxnvctrl: allow for realtime monitoring of your NVIDIA cards temperature,
libxnvctrl: fan speed, memory, etc.
