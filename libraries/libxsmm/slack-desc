# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libxsmm: libxsmm (Library for matrix operations and deep learning primitives)
libxsmm:
libxsmm:   LIBXSMM is a library for specialized dense and sparse matrix 
libxsmm: operations as well as for deep learning primitives such as small 
libxsmm: convolutions. The library is targeting Intel Architecture with 
libxsmm: Intel SSE, Intel AVX, Intel AVX2, Intel AVX512 (with VNNI and 
libxsmm: Bfloat16), and Intel AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions) supported by 
libxsmm: future Intel processor code-named Sapphire Rapids.
