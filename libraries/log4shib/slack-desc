# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

log4shib: log4shib (log4j-like logging library)
log4shib:
log4shib: log4shib is a forked version of log4cpp that has been created for the
log4shib: Shibboleth project to ensure a consistent, working snapshot that
log4shib: builds reliably on the necessary platforms.
log4shib: Log for C++ is a library of classes for flexible logging to files,
log4shib: syslog, and other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java
log4shib: library and stays as close to its API as is reasonable.
