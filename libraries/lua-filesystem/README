LuaFileSystem is a Lua library developed to complement the set
of functions related to filesystems offered by the standard
Lua distribution.

LuaFileSystem offers a portable way to access the underlying
directory structure and file attributes.

Optional dependency: lua51. If lua51 is installed at build time, this
package will contain a module for Lua 5.1.
