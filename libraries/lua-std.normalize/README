This module can inject deterministic versions of core Lua
functions that do not behave identically across all supported Lua
implementations into your module's lexical environment.   Each
function is as thin and fast a version as is possible in each Lua
implementation, evaluating to the Lua C implementation with no
overhead when semantics allow.

Optional dependency: lua51. If lua51 is installed at build time, this
package will contain a module for Lua 5.1.
