Simple streaming interface to zlib for Lua. Consists of two functions:
inflate and deflate. Both functions return "stream functions" (takes a
buffer of input and returns a buffer of output).

Optional dependency: lua51. If lua51 is installed at build time, this
package will contain a module for Lua 5.1.
