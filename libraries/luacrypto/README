luacrypto provides a Lua frontend to the OpenSSL cryptographic lib.
The OpenSSL features that are currently exposed are digests (MD5,
SHA-1, HMAC, and more) and crypto-grade random number generators.
luacrypto also supports encryption and decryption, signing and
verifying, sealing and opening using the OpenSSL EVP API.
