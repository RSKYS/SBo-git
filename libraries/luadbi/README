LuaDBI is a database interface library for Lua. It is designed to
provide a RDBMS agnostic API for handling database operations. LuaDBI
also provides support for prepared statement handles, placeholders
and bind parameters for all database operations.

Currently LuaDBI supports DB2, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite
databases with native database drivers.

Optitional requirements:
databases (at least one from mysql, psql, sqlite3, db2, oracle)
You can pass to slackbuild list of databases you want LuaDBI to work
with (e.g. DBs="psql sqline3 oracle" or DBs="free db2").

free - builds MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite3 drivers
all - as above, but also builds DB2 and Oracle drivers
mysql
psql
sqlite3
db2
oracle

By default, mysql and sqlite3 support are built.

Optional dependency: lua51. If lua51 is installed at build time, this
package will contain a module for Lua 5.1.
