A binding for OpenSSL library to provide TLS/SSL communication over
LuaSocket. This version delegates to LuaSocket the TCP connection
establishment between the client and server. Then LuaSec uses this
connection to start a secure TLS/SSL session.

Optional dependency: lua51. If lua51 is installed at build time, this
package will contain a module for Lua 5.1.
