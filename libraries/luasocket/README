LuaSocket is a Lua extension library that is composed by two parts: a
C core that provides support for the TCP and UDP transport layers,
and a set of Lua modules that add support for functionality commonly
needed by applications that deal with the Internet. 

The library is available under the same terms and conditions as the
Lua language, the MIT license. The idea is that if you can use Lua in
a project, you should also be able to use LuaSocket.
