# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

luasocket: luasocket (Network support for the Lua language)
luasocket:
luasocket: LuaSocket is a Lua extension library that is composed by two parts: a
luasocket: C core that provides support for the TCP and UDP transport layers,
luasocket: and a set of Lua modules that add support for functionality commonly
luasocket: needed by applications that deal with the Internet.
luasocket:
luasocket: The library is available under the same terms and conditions as the
luasocket: Lua language, the MIT license. The idea is that if you can use Lua in
luasocket: a project, you should also be able to use LuaSocket.
