MathGL - library for scientific data visualization.

MathGL is a library for making high-quality scientific graphics under
Linux and Windows. It is useful for fast data plotting and data proc-
essing of large data arrays. Supports working in window and console
modes and for easy embedding into other programs. Has a large and
still growing set of graphics.

It can be compiled with several different options, however, since with
basic Slackware installation most of them are already present, only
three optional configuration flags are present, and represent optional
dependencies: GSL -- GNU Scientific Library, GNU Octave (a Matlab
clone) and openmpi, all of which are accessible on slackbuilds.org.

GSL=yes (for GSL support, needs gsl)
OCTAVE=yes (for Octave support, needs octave)
OPENMPI=yes (for Open MPI support, needs openmpi)

add the ones needed when launching the slackbuilds, like

  GSL=yes OCTAVE=yes ./mathgl.SlackBuild
