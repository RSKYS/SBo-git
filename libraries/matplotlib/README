Matplotlib strives to produce publication quality 2D graphics for
interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface
development and web application servers targeting multiple user
interfaces and hardcopy output formats.  The 'pylab' mode
of ipython uses matplotlib to emulate matlab graphics.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES: pytest, mock, ffmpeg/avconv, Inkscape,
                       wxPython3

NOTES: The optional wxagg backend is disabled by default because
       of possible issues related to wxPython versions. If you
       wish to use this backend install wxPython3 in advance and
       set DISABLE_WXAGG to "no" when executing the SlackBuild.
       IMPORTANT: There is some interaction between wxPython and
                  wxPython3, pay attention to the corresponding
                  README files.

       If you want to enable the optional subpackages tests and
       toolkits_tests you need to set the variable ENABLE_TESTS
       to "yes" when executing the SlackBuild and make sure that
       pytest, mock, ffmpeg/avconv and Inkscape are already
       installed. Besides ffmpeg/avconv are also needed if you
       wish better support of animation output formats.
