The Munkres module provides an implementation of the Munkres algorithm
(also called the Hungarian algorithm or the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm).
The algorithm models an assignment problem as an NxM cost matrix,
where each element represents the cost of assigning the i-th worker to
j-th job, and it figures out the least-cost solution, choosing a
single item from each row and column in the matrix, such that no row
and no column are used more than once.

If you want to build this for use with Python 2.x (needs the
optional dependency python2) pass the script PYTHON2=yes, like
  PYTHON2=yes ./munkres.SlackBuild
