Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can
use to read XML and XML-like data files in your
application without requiring large non-standard libraries.

Mini-XML supports reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and writing
of UTF-8 encoded XML files and strings. Data is stored in
a linked-list tree structure, preserving the XML data hierarchy,
and arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values
are supported with no preset limits, just available memory.
