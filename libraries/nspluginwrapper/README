nspluginwrapper is a proxy plug-in and viewer for NPAPI browser
plug-ins. It allows browsers to run foreign plug-ins built for a
different architecture, most commonly to run a 32-bit plug-in in a
64-bit browser.

This is needed by 64bit midori compiled against GTK3 to use the flash
plugin:

cd /usr/lib64/mozilla/plugins
nspluginwrapper -v -a -n -i libflashplayer.so
