OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for
desktop and embedded systems based on JavaSE. It is a collaborative effort by
many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient,
and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications.

This SlackBuild is based on a binary build of OpenJFX provided by Chris
Newland, https://chriswhocodes.com/

This SlackBuild should be used specifically with OpenJDK, because the
Oracle JRE and JDK already include JavaFX.
