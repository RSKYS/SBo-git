This is a Qt project for making use of OpenSceneGraph (OSG).

By default, this SlackBuild will build a Qt4 library.
If a Qt5 version is desired instead, set the OSGQT
environment variable when building osgQt i.e.
    OSGQT=5 sh osgQt.SlackBuild
In this case, the qt5 package is an additional requirement
when building.
