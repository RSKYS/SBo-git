Modern, powerful open source C++ class libraries and frameworks for
building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop,
server, mobile and embedded systems.

PostgreSQL (on Sbo) and libiodbc (part of Slackware) or UnixODBC
(on SBo) are optional dependencies that will be automatically picked
up during configuration. If you have PostgreSQL installed and want to
compile the corresponding database connector, do this:

  POSTGRESQL=yes ./poco.SlackBuild
