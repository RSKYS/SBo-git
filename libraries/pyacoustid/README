Chromaprint and its associated Acoustid Web service make up a
high-quality, open-source acoustic fingerprinting system.
This package provides Python bindings for both the fingerprinting
algorithm library, which is written in C but portable, and the Web
service, which provides fingerprint lookups.

If you want to build this for use with Python 2.x (require python2)
pass the script PYTHON2=yes, like
  PYTHON2=yes ./pyacoustid.SlackBuild
