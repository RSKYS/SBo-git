QuaZIP is a simple C++ wrapper over Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package
that can be used to access ZIP archives. It uses the Qt toolkit.

QuaZIP allows you to access files inside ZIP archives using QIODevice
API, and - yes! - that means that you can also use QTextStream,
QDataStream or whatever you would like to use on your zipped files.

QuaZIP provides complete abstraction of the ZIP/UNZIP API, for both
reading from and writing to ZIP archives.
