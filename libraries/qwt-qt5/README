Qwt is an extension to the Qt5 GUI library that contains widgets and components
which are primarily useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a
framework for 2D plots it provides scales, sliders, dials, compasses,
thermometers, wheels and knobs to control or display values, arrays, or ranges
of type double.
