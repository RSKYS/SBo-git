Qwt is an extension to the Qt GUI library from Troll Tech AS.  The Qwt
library contains widgets and components which are primarily useful
for technical and scientifical purposes. It includes a 2-D plotting
widget, different kinds of sliders, and much more.

Optional dependency: qt4. If installed, the package will include qt4
support.

If you're interested in developing software that uses qwt, you might
want to build this with EXAMPLES=yes in the environment. This will
compile the example programs and install them in the doc dir.
