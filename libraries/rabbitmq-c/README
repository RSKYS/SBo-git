If BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON or BUILD_TESTS=ON then executable programs will
be compiled from sources in /usr/doc/rabbitmq-c-$VERSION/examples/src/
-and-or- /usr/doc/rabbitmq-c-$VERSION/examples/src/ The Extra Programs
will be installed in /usr/doc/rabbitmq-c-$VERSION/{examples,tests}/bin/

For Example, to build examples and tests:

BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON BUILD_TESTS=ON ./rabbitmq-c.SlackBuild

To build a nice html Doxygen API documentation tree in the directory
/usr/doc/rabbitmq-c-$VERSION/html/ you need to pass BUILD_API_DOCS=ON
to the script, for example

  BUILD_API_DOCS=ON ./rabbitmq-c.SlackBuild

To build examples, tests and the html documentation:

BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
BUILD_TESTS=ON \
BUILD_API_DOCS=ON ./rabbitmq-c.SlackBuild
