This is a C-language AMQP client library for use with v2.0+ of the
RabbitMQ broker.

Under the /usr/doc/rabbitmq-c-$VERSION/ directory are examples/ and
tests/ subdirectories.

To build a nice html Doxygen API documentation tree in the directory
/usr/doc/rabbitmq-c-$VERSION/html/ you need to pass BUILD_API_DOCS=ON
to the script, for example

  BUILD_API_DOCS=ON ./rabbitmq-c.SlackBuild
