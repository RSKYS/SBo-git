Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated.  Redland
implements each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object
based API, reflected into the language APIs, currently C#, Java,
Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl.
