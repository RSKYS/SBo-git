remglk (remote-procedure-call implementation of the Glk IF API)

remglk is an implementation of the Glk Interactive Fiction library which
supports structured input and output.

RemGlk does not provide a user interface. Instead, it wraps up the
application's output as a JSON data structure and sends it to stdout. It
then waits for input to arrive from stdin; the input data must also be
encoded as JSON.
