# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

remglk: remglk is an implementation of the Glk Interactive Fiction library
remglk: which supports structured input and output.

remglk: RemGlk does not provide a user interface. Instead, it wraps up
remglk: the application's output as a JSON data structure and sends it to
remglk: stdout. It then waits for input to arrive from stdin; the input data
remglk: must also be encoded as JSON.
