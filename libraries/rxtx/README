RXTX is a Java library providing serial and parallel port communication.

To build RXTX requires the jdk package (available in Slackware's extra/
directory).

If you are upgrading from rxtx-2.0_7pre2, please note that the javacomm
package is no longer required and should be uninstalled before building
rxtx-2.2pre2.
