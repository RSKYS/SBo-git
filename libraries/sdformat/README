SDF is an XML format that describes objects and environments for
robot simulators, visualization, and control. Originally developed
as part of the Gazebo robot simulator, SDF was designed with
scientific robot applications in mind.

Over the years, SDF has become a stable, robust, and extensible format
capable of describing all aspects of robots, static and dynamic objects,
lighting, terrain, and even physics.
