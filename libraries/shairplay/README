shairplay (AirPlay server)

Apple airplay and raop protocol server.

This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming
music from iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements a server for the
Apple RAOP protocol.

NOTE: Ensure that avahi-daemon is running for this to work. It is
recommended to make /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon executable and to start
it automatically on boot using /etc/rc.d/rc.local. See avahi's 
README.SBo for more info
