# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

smmap2: smmap2 (A sliding memory map manager)
smmap2:
smmap2: Smmap wraps an interface around mmap and tracks the mapped files as
smmap2: well as the amount of clients who use it. If the system runs out of
smmap2: resources, or if a memory limit is reached, it will automatically
smmap2: unload unused maps to allow continued operation.
