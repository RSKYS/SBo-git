Very fast, header-only/compiled, C++ logging library.

fmt is an optional dependency and will be autodetected if installed.

This scripts builds both 32bit and 64bit libraries by autodetecting
multilib. If you are on a multilib system and only wish to build the
64bit library, pass COMPAT32=no to the build script.
