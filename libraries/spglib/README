Spglib is a C library that implements a computer algorithm to search
crystal symmetries of crystal structures.
It is supported as optional dependency in Avogadro 2 or can be used
with python, fortran, rust, and ruby interfaces.

This slackbuild installs by default the Python interface and the 
support to system OPENMP. You can disable both or one of these options
passing the respective environment variable
  PYTHON=no ./spglib.SlackBuild   (python3-numpy not required)
  OMP=no ./spglib.SlackBuild 

The build of Fortran interface is disabled by default. You can enable
this option passing
  FORTRAN=yes ./spglib.SlackBuild
