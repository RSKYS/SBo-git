The SQLite Database Engine provides a lightweight C library to access
database files using a large subset of SQL92 without the overhead of
RDBMS server processes. In order to use that functionality as a
desktop database, the SQLite library is wrapped into an ODBC driver.

To install the library documentation pass DOC=yes to the slackbuild as

   DOC=yes ./sqliteodbc.SlackBuild

unixODBC is an optional dependency and can be used in place of
libiodbc in Slackware.

See README.SLACKWARE for post-install information.
