# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sqliteodbc:
sqliteodbc: The SQLite Database Engine provides a lightweight C library to access
sqliteodbc: database files using a large subset of SQL92 without the overhead of
sqliteodbc: RDBMS server processes. In order to use that functionality as a
sqliteodbc: desktop database, the SQLite library is wrapped into an ODBC driver.
