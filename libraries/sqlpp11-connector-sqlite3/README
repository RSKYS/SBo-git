sqlpp11 offers you to code SQL in C++ almost naturally. You can 
use tables, columns and functions. Everything has strong types 
which allow the compiler to help you a lot. At compile time, it
will tell about most of those pesky oversight errors you can 
make (typos, comparing apples with oranges, forgetting tables 
in a select statement, etc). And it does not stop at query 
construction. Results have ranges, and strongly typed members, 
so that you can browse through results in a type-safe manner, 
worthy of modern C++.

sqlpp11 requires a certain api in order to connect with the 
database, sqlpp11-connector-sqlite3 is a SQL connector for 
the Sqlite3 database.
