The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio
signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the
C++ programming language. STK was designed to facilitate rapid
development of music synthesis and audio processing software, with
an emphasis on cross-platform functionality, realtime control,
ease of use, and educational example code.

Optional dependencies:
* oss, for OSS audio API support
* jack, for JACK audio API support

Build Options:

STK has 3 audio APIs to choose from, that you can control by
passing the AUDIOAPI variable value to the slackbuild.

AUDIOAPI=alsa (default, choose native ALSA API support)

AUDIOAPI=oss (choose native OSS API support, requires oss)

AUDIOAPI=jack (choose native JACK server API support, requires jack)
