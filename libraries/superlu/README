SuperLU contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system 
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP). 
The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the 
preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.

SuperLU is implemented in ANSI C, and must be compiled with standard 
ANSI C compilers. It provides functionality for both real and complex
matrices, in both single and double precision. The file names for the 
single-precision real version start with letter "s" (such as sgstrf.c);
the file names for the double-precision real version start with letter
"d" (such as dgstrf.c); the file names for the single-precision complex
version start with letter "c" (such as cgstrf.c); the file names for
the double-precision complex version start with letter "z" (such as
zgstrf.c).

NOTE:
OpenBLAS can be used instead of blas, and is recommended for better
performance.
