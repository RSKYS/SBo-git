# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tblis: tblis (a library and framework for performing tensor operations)
tblis:
tblis:   TBLIS is a library and framework for performing tensor operations,
tblis: especially tensor contraction, using native algorithms. In this
tblis: context, native means that TBLIS does not translate tensor operations
tblis: into matrix operations using the BLAS libraries. Instead, TBLIS uses
tblis: the philosophy (and certain low-level kernels) of the BLIS framework
tblis: to implement tensor contraction with essentially zero overhead
tblis: compared to matrix multiplication. TBLIS also aims to offer a
tblis: convenient C++ interface for tensors and tensor operations, as well
tblis: as a stable C interface with high portability.
