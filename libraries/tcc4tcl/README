tcc4tcl (Tiny C Compiler for Tcl) is a Tcl extension that provides
an interface to TCC. It is a fork of tcltcc by Mark Janssen.

It makes extending Tcl with C and creating compiled package
extensions a simple and interactive experience. It incorporates TinyCC,
a small yet featureful C compiler that works fast enough to be used as
a JIT compiler.

In addition to the TinyCC binding, tcc4tcl allows quick wrapping of C
functions into Tcl procedures, and saving these procedures in libraries
loadable as package extensions using the load command. It is similar to
Critcl, except that the compiler is included.
