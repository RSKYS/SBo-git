TCLAP is a small templatized library that provides a simple interface
for defining and accessing command line arguments. It was intially
inspired by the user friendly CLAP libary.

By default, the API documentation is not built, as it's rather
resource-intensive, and not required unless you're a developer. If
you need the API docs, install graphviz, then run this build with
APIDOC=yes in the environment.
