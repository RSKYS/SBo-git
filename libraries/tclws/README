 This package provides a Tcl implementation of both client side access
 to Web Services and server side creation of Web Services. Currently
 only document/literal and rpc/encoded with HTTP Soap transport are
 supported on the client side. The server side code currently works
 with several web servers:
* TclHttpd
* Apache with Rivet
* AOLserver
* WUB
* wibble
* Microsoft IIS

The server side code can also be embedded in other applications
