The Apache Tomcat Native Library is an optional component for use
with Apache Tomcat that allows Tomcat to use certain native resources
for performance, compatibility, etc.

Specifically, the Apache Tomcat Native Library gives Tomcat access to
the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library's network connection
(socket) implementation and random-number generator.
