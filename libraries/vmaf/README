VMAF is a perceptual video quality assessment algorithm
developed by NetFlix. This software includes a standalone C
library libvmaf and its wrapping python library. The python
also provides a set of tools that allows user to train and test
a custom VMAF model.

This is an optional dependency for FFmpeg.
