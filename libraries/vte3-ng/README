VTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for
GTK+, and a minimal sample application (vte) using that.  Vte is mainly
used in gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal
in games, editors, IDEs, etc.

This package will conflicts with the stock vte package in Slackware, so 
be sure to remove it first before installing this package.
