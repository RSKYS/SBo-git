# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

waylandpp: waylandpp (Wayland C++ bindings)
waylandpp:
waylandpp: Wayland is an object oriented display protocol, which features request
waylandpp: and events. Requests can be seen as method calls on certain objects,
waylandpp: whereas events can be seen as signals of an object. This makes the
waylandpp: Wayland protocol a perfect candidate for a C++ binding.
waylandpp:
waylandpp: The goal of this library is to create such a C++ binding for Wayland
waylandpp: using the most modern C++ technology currently available, providing
waylandpp: an easy to use C++ API to Wayland.
