# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wv:
wv: wv converts Word 2,6,7,8,9 files to html and latex.
wv: The Word 2 conversion is still incomplete (no formatting),
wv: but it will do a passable job extracting the text, which
wv: is what you probably want anyway.
