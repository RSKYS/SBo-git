wxGTK3 is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native
platform's controls and utilities.

webkit2gtk is an optional dependency of this package. This will
provide webview support.

Notes:

1. This package is NOT built using --enable-stl by default.
   If you need to enable stl, use:
   STL=yes ./wxGTK3.SlackBuild

2. If you need to build static version, use:
   STATIC=yes ./wxGTK3.SlackBuild
   When building with static libraries, plugin support will be disabled.

3. This script also auto-detects webkitgtk presence. If it's installed,
   it will automatically use the --enable-webkit parameter.

4. If you need the wxGTK3 API documentation, you can include it in the
   package by installing graphviz, then running wxGTK3.SlackBuild with
   APIDOC=yes in the environment. You won't need the API docs unless
   you're developing software that uses wxGTK3.

Conflict warning:

wxGTK3 can be installed alongside wxPython{3,4}/wxWidgets, but it will
overwrite the /usr/bin/wx-config created by wxPython{3,4}/wxWidgets.

If you need to build packages using wxPython{3,4}/wxWidgets, simply
reinstall the wxPython{3,4}/wxWidgets package and wx-config will point
to correct version.

The same solution can be used if wxGTK3's wx-config is overwritten
by wxPython{3,4}/wxWidgets.
