wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language.
It allows Python programmers to create programs with a robust,
highly functional graphical user interface simply and easily.  It is
implemented as a Python extension module (native code) that wraps the
popular wxWidgets cross platform GUI library which is written in C++.

If you want support for gnomeprint pass GNOMEPRINT=yes to the
script. This will require libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui, both
available from SlackBuilds.org.

Another optional dependency is libmspack, which is used by the CHM help
viewer.

wxPython can be installed alongside wxGTK3/wxWidgets, but it will
overwrite the /usr/bin/wx-config created by wxGTK3/wxWidgets.

If you need to build packages using wxGTK3/wxWidgets, simply reinstall
the wxGTK3/wxWidgets and wx-config will point to correct version.

The same solution can be used if wxPython's wx-config is overwritten.
