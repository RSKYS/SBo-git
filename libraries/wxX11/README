wxWidgets lets developers create applications for Win32, Mac OS X, GTK+, X11, 
Motif, WinCE, and more using one codebase. It can be used from languages such 
as C++, Python, Perl, and C#/.NET. Unlike other cross- platform toolkits, 
wxWidgets applications look and feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses 
the platform's own native controls rather than emulating them.

This package is built with the '--disable-gui' flag, which requires GTK1 or 
GTK2. If you need it for that purpose, then you need to track down those gtk 
dependencies.
