# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wxX11: wxX11 (wxWidgets application framework)
wxX11:
wxX11: wxWidgets lets developers create applications for
wxX11: Win32, Mac OS X, GTK+, X11, Motif, WinCE, and more using
wxX11: one codebase. It can be used from languages such as
wxX11: C++, Python, Perl, and C#/.NET. Unlike other cross-
wxX11: platform toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and
wxX11: feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses the
wxX11: platform's own native controls rather than emulating them.
