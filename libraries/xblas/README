This library of routines is part of a reference implementation for the
Dense and Banded BLAS routines, along with their Extended and Mixed
Precision versions.

Extended Precision is only used internally; the input and output
arguments remain the same as in the existing BLAS.

Mixed Precision permits some input/output arguments to be of different
types (mixing real/complex) or precisions (mixing single/double).
