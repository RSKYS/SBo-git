# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xblas: xblas (Extra Precise Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines)
xblas:
xblas: This library of routines is part of a reference implementation for the
xblas: Dense and Banded BLAS routines, along with their Extended and Mixed
xblas: Precision versions.
xblas:
xblas: Extended Precision is only used internally; the input and output
xblas: arguments remain the same as in the existing BLAS.
xblas:
xblas: Mixed Precision permits some input/output arguments to be of different
xblas: types (mixing real/complex) or precisions (mixing single/double).
