# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xgboost: xgboost (XGBoost - Optimized distributed gradient boosting library)
xgboost:
xgboost:   XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library
xgboost: designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It
xgboost: implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting
xgboost: framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as
xgboost: GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and
xgboost: accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed environment
xgboost: (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of
xgboost: examples.
