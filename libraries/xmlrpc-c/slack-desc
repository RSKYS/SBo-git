# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xmlrpc-c:
xmlrpc-c: XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the
xmlrpc-c: Internet. It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends it
xmlrpc-c: to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.
