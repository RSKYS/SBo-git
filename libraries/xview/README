xview (X11 toolkit for OPEN LOOK applications)

XView is a cross-platform X11 toolkit which implements OPEN LOOK
specification. It was originally created by Sun Microsystems (now
Oracle), since then it was developed by community. It comes with
several OPEN LOOK applications, including window managers (olwm,
olvwm), text editors (oledit, textedit), clock (olclock) and a
simple calculator (olcalc).

Due to conflict with /sbin/clock, XView's clock was renamed to olclock.

Note to 64-bit users: xview isn't "64-bit clean". The window managers
(olwm, olvwm) work, but the applications crash with a segfault on
startup.
