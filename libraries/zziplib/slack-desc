# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zziplib: zziplib (A lightweight zip library)
zziplib:
zziplib: The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the
zziplib: ability to easily extract data from files archived in a single zip
zziplib: file. Applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and
zziplib: access them. The implementation is based only on the (free) subset
zziplib: of compression with the  zlib algorithm which is actually used by the
zziplib: zip/unzip tools.
