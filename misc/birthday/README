Birthday

This is a little program which I originally wrote when I was learning
C, some time ago now.  It has gone through a couple of total
re-writes, the last of which was four or five years ago now[0], but I
still find it a useful program.

It displays a list of events which are coming up in the near future,
based on a config file (~/.birthdays) in the user's home directory.  I
include it in my .profile, so I get the list every time I log on.  See
the manpage for more details of this format.
