ASCII BOX DRAWING - THE BOXES FILTER PROGRAM

boxes is a text filter which can draw ASCII art boxes around
its input text. These boxes may also be removed, even if they
have been badly damaged by editing of the text inside. Since
boxes may be open on any side, boxes can also be used to
create regional comments in any programming language. With
the help of an editor macro or mapping, damaged boxes can
easily be repaired.

This is useful for making the function headers in your
programming language look better, for spicing up your news
postings and emails, or just for decorating your documentation
files.

New box designs of all sorts can easily be added and shared
by appending to a free format configuration file. boxes was
intended to be used with the vim(1) text editor, but can be
tied to any text editor which supports filters.
