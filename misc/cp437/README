cp437 (emulate code page 437 on a UTF-8 terminal)

cp437 is a program to emulate an old-style "code page 437" / "IBM-PC"
character set terminal on a modern terminal emulator that uses UTF-8
or similar.

It was written for the purpose of running the BitchX IRC client,
which utilises CP437 line-drawing characters in its default theme and
artwork. It should also be broadly useful for things like viewing
CP437 "ANSI art", running nethack with the IBMgraphics option or
running EPIC with scripts that use CP437 artwork.

It's also useful for converting old CP437-encoded text files to UTF-8.
