# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fbdump: fbdump (captures the visible portion of framebuffer to stdout)
fbdump:
fbdump: fbdump is a simple tool that captures the contents of the visible
fbdump: portion of the Linux framebuffer device and writes it to the standard
fbdump: output as a PPM file. In other words, it takes a screenshot of
fbdump: anything running on the framebuffer. It currently has fairly complete
fbdump: support for packed-pixel framebuffer types and also works with the
fbdump: VGA16 framebuffer driver.
