Floating IPS (or Flips) is a patcher for IPS and BPS files, aiming for
a simple interface yet plenty of power under the hood.

Features:

  * Creates the smallest BPS patches of any known tool in existence,
    and is faster than any other comparable creator
  * Creates the smallest IPS patches of any known tool in existence,
    too (but only a little smaller, Lunar IPS is quite good)
  * Fully-featured GUIs under Windows and GTK+, including command line
    support; can also be a pure command line program
  * Can apply multiple patches to the same ROM, creating a huge pile
    of ROMs (GUI only)
  * Can remembers which ROMs you've used, and use them again if it
    thinks it's correct (BPS only, GUI only)
  * Can launch other programs after patching the ROMs; together with
    the above, this allows you to double click a BPS to launch an
    emulator (GUI only)
