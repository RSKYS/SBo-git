font-unscii (bitmapped Unicode font for blocky graphics)

Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts based on classic system
fonts. Unscii attempts to support character cell art well while also
being suitable for terminal and programming use.

The package include PCF, TTF, and OTF fonts for use with X. No
console (PSF) fonts are included: These fonts have over 2500 glyphs
each, but the console only supports 512 glyphs per font. Most of the
special character art glyphs would have to be omitted from a console
conversion.
