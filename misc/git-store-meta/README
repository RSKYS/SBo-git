git-store-meta is a light-weight tool for file metadata storing and
applying for Git.

Features:

- Light dependency, cross-platform consistent behavior,
  desirable performance.
- Data files are in plain text format and can be easily revisioned,
  diffed, or manually modified as needed.
- Supported metadata: mtime, atime, mode, user, uid, group, gid, acl.
- Can store the metadata of git-revisioned files into a data file.
- Can apply the metadata stored in the data file to the working copy.
- Can update the metadata for changed files quickly.
- Can easily pick which metadata fields to store, update, or apply.
- Can determine whether to store, update, or apply directory metadata.

Note:

  The binary is installed under the name "git-store-meta". Use it
  instead of "git-store-meta.pl" when reading online docs or in Git
  hooks. The `--install` switch already knows to use "git-store-meta"
  and will create correct hooks without any further action required.
