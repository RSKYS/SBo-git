grc (generic colouriser)

grc provides two programs: grc and grcat. The main one is grcat,
which acts as a filter, i.e. taking standard input, colourising it
and writing to standard output. grcat takes as a parameter the name of
configuration file.

One major use of grc is to colorize the output of commonly-used shell
commands. For this to work, grc has to set up the environment of your
shell when it starts up. How you do this depends on which shell you
use.
