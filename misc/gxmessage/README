Gxmessage is an xmessage clone for GTK based desktops. Gxmessage pops up
a dialog window, displays a given message or question, then waits for
the user's response. That response is returned as the program's exit
code. Because gxmessage is a drop-in alternative to xmessage, gxmessage
accepts any option xmessage would, and returns the same exit codes.

If you wish to disable NLS, pass 'NLS=disable' to the SlackBuild.
