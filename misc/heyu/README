heyu (X10 module controller software)

This program operates an X10 module via a CM11A computer interface.
It's based on the program X10 by Larry Cambell as modified by Paul
Fox. All but a few functions have been changed enough that they no
longer interwork with the original. I think this justifies issuing the
program as 'heyu' instead of 'x10'.

The program is strictly command line driven, and works well with
crontab. Crontab can be used to schedule events. You can also upload
timers and macros to the CM11's memory.

The program comes complete with source code, sample config files, man
pages, and executable binary. The program has options to allow you to:

   * Get the date and time from the interface
   * Get information about current settings and module states
   * Turn an X10 module on or off
   * Dim or brighten an X10 module
   * Monitor all data sent to or from the CM11A
   * Get the status of intelligent X10 modules (rr501 for instance)
   * Set the X10 clock from the computer's clock (time and date)
   * Zero out the macro and event memory of the X10
   * Upload macros and timers
   * preset the dim level of advanced two way devices
