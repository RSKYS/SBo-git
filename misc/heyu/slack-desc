# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

heyu: heyu (X10 module controller software)
heyu:
heyu: This program operates an X10 module via a CM11A computer interface.
heyu: It is based on the X10 program by Larry Cambell as modified by
heyu: Paul Fox. All but a few functions have been changed enough that
heyu: they no longer interwork with the original. I think this justifies
heyu: issuing the program as 'heyu' instead of 'x10'.
