KDE CDEmu Manager is a simple frontend for CDEmu.

It provides a little manager window that gives you an overview of your
virtual drives and allows you to mount and unmount images. It also
includes a KDE service menu for mounting images directly from
Dolphin/Konqueror (which is what most people will want to use). Images
can be unmounted like any other media through Dolphin or the Device
Notifier plasmoid.
