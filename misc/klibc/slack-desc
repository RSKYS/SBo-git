# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

klibc: initramfs.  It is deliberately written for small size, minimal
klibc: entanglement, and portability rather than speed.  It is definitely
klibc: a work in progress, and a lot of things are still missing.
