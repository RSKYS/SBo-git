linux_logo has been showing Linux ASCII art penguins since 1997.
It shows a Linux logo with some customisable system info.

Add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

/usr/bin/linux_logo > /etc/issue
/usr/bin/linux_logo > /etc/issue.net

and the penguin appears at all the login prompts, even remote ones.
