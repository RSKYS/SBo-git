# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

megatunix: megatunix (MegaSquirt tuning software)
megatunix:
megatunix: MegaTunix is the only native tuning software for Unix (and now
megatunix: Win32) class operating systems that supports the majority of
megatunix: megasquirt firmwares. It has been redesigned in such a way as to
megatunix: be extensible to support new firmware variants with little to no
megatunix: new code needing to be written. The new design permits the gui
megatunix: tabs that relate to MegaSquirt variables to be redesigned using
megatunix: the Glade GUI designer for windows or Glade gui designer for Unix
megatunix: to change or alter the gui look/feel to accomodate new controls on
megatunix: more advanced firmwares.
