Philip's Music Writer, previously called Philip's Music Scribe, was
written by Philip Hazel as a simple way for people to create sheet
music on a computer running the Linux operating system.

pmw uses a special internal language to encode musical notation. Files
can be created and modified in any text editor. The pmw command-line
program translates the input text file into an output postscript file
of music manuscript, using a special "alphabet" of symbols. A user
manual in PDF format is provided as part of the package.
