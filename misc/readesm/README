readesm shows the content of digital tachograph files.
This program takes an ESM file (possible file extensions are .esm .dd
.tgd or .add) downloaded from a digital tachograph or a driver card
(used in the European Union for trucks > 3.5 tons) and converts it
into human-readable form, either html or simple plaintext.
