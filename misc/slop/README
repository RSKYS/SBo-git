slop (Select Operation)

slop is an application that querys for a selection from the user and
prints the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and turns it into a
crosshair, lets the user click and drag to make a selection (or click
on a window) while drawing a pretty box around it, then finally prints
the selection's dimensions to stdout.
