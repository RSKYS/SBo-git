swege is a Static WEbsite GEnerator written in C. It leverages the
discount library for generating a website from a set of Markdown files.

You can obtain a template project from /usr/share/swege-*/example.

Copy the example directory to a location of choice:
`cp -r /usr/share/swege-*/example ~/mycoolsite`

Enter your directory, edit swege.ini and run swege:
`cd ~/mycoolsite && $EDITOR swege.ini && swege`

For FAQ, and other information read the project README.md, can be
found in /usr/share/swege-*/repository-README.md.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You have to write two files: the header, and the footer. These get
added to the top, and the bottom of the rest of the pages of your
website.

All the Markdown (*.md) files, prior to being copied into the output
folder, are translated into HTML during "compilation". The rest of the
files are simply copied to the output folder.
