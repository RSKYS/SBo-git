tal is a filter that reads in lines from standard input. The lines are
sent to standard output with common trailing characters aligned so that
they all begin and end on the same column of text. This can be used to
repair 'broken boxes' or align the backslashes on long macro definitions
in C programs. But tal will work on any kind of common ending and is
especially useful as a filter for the vim text editor.
