# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tal: tal (trailer alignment filter)
tal:
tal: tal is a filter that reads in lines from standard input. The lines
tal: are sent to standard output with common trailing characters aligned
tal: so that they all begin and end on the same column of text. This can
tal: be used to repair 'broken boxes' or align the backslashes on long
tal: macro definitions in C programs. But tal will work on any kind of
tal: common ending and is especially useful as a filter for the vim text
tal: editor.
