The TOIlet project attempts to create a free replacement for the FIGlet
utility. TOIlet stands for The Other Implementation letters, coined
after FIGlet Frank, Ian and Glens letter. TOIlet is in its very early
development phase. It uses the powerful libcaca library to achieve
various text-based effects. TOIlet also aims for full FIGlet
compatibility. It is currently able to load FIGlet fonts and perform
horizontal smushing.
