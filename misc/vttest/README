vttest (terminal test program)

Vttest is a program designed to test the functionality of a VT100
terminal (or emulator thereof). It tests both display (escape sequence
handling) and keyboard.

Additional tests (past version 1.7) are provided for analysis of
vt220, vt420 terminals, as well as variants of xterm.

The program is menu-driven and contains full on-line operating
instructions.
