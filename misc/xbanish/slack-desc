# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xbanish:
xbanish: xbanish hides the mouse cursor when you start typing, and shows it
xbanish: again when the mouse cursor moves or a mouse button is pressed.
xbanish: This is similar to xterm's pointerMode setting, but xbanish works
xbanish: globally in the X11 session.
