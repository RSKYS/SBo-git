xcape (Linux utility to configure modifier keys)

xcape allows you to use a modifier key as another key when pressed and
released on its own. Note that it is slightly slower than pressing the 
original key, because the pressed event does not occur until the key  
is released.

The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when Left Control
is pressed and released on its own.
