# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xclip:
xclip: xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any
xclip: system with an X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X
xclip: selections ("the clipboard") from the command line. It can read
xclip: data from standard input or a file, and place it in an X selection
xclip: for pasting into other X applications. xclip can also print an X
xclip: selection to standard out, which can then be redirected to a file
xclip: or another program.
