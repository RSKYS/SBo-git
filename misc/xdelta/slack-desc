# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xdelta: xdelta (Binary delta generator)
xdelta:
xdelta: Xdelta is an application program designed to compute changes between
xdelta: files. These changes (deltas) are similar to the output of the "diff"
xdelta: program in that they may be used to store and transmit only the
xdelta: changes between files. However, unlike diff, the output of Xdelta is
xdelta: not expressed in a human-readable format.
xdelta: Xdelta uses a fast, linear algorithm and performs well on both binary
xdelta: and text files.
