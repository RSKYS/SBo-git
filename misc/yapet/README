YAPET (Yet Another Password Encryption Tool)

YAPET is a text based password manager using the Blowfish encryption
algorithm to store passwords and associated information encrypted on
disk.  Its primary aim is to provide a safe way to store passwords in
a file on disk while having a small footprint, and compiling and
running under today's most popular Unix systems.

The password records are protected by a master password which is used
to encrypt and decrypt the password records.
