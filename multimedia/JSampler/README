You want a pretty LinuxSampler GUI? Try JSampler today!

This SlackBuild will build JSampler from source code.

If you don't have apache-ant installed (but only java),
then this SlackBuild installs the pre-built .jar file.

| If you are compiling:  \________________________________
|                                                         \
| JSampler has two themes: jsclassic and fantasia. The    |
| default is fantasia but you may choose classic by       |
| passing this variable to the SlackBuild:                |
|                                                         |
| THEME=jsclassic                                         |
|                                                         |
