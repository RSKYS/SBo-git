Yolo (Lipsync Exposure Sheet Generator)

Yolo is a Java program for creating timesheets to sync animation to a
pre-recorded audio track.

Specifically, Yolo analyses a WAV file against plain text sides, and,
given a frame rate, generates an exposure sheet. Animators can use
the exposure sheet to sync the lips of an animated character with the
dialogue.

Yolo does not parse the words contained within the WAV file on its own;
you must provide it both the audio and the scripted dialogue. As long as
it has these two things, it effectively provides a phonemic breakdown
of the dialogue, an example drawing of the mouth position, and a frame
count for each sound.
