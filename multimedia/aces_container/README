A reference implementation for an ACES container file writer intended
to be used with the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES). The
resulting file is compliant with the ACES container specification
(SMPTE S2065-4).

NOT included in this reference implementation:

* Stereo channels
* EndOfFileFiller
* Arbitrary attributes and naming validations
* half type attributes
* keycode value validations

You'll want this if you are working in an ACES workflow, in the motion
picture industry, and do not otherwise have anything to output to an
ACES file (for instance, if you are using ctlrender independently).
