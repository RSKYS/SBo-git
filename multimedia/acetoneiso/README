AcetoneISO (CD/DVD image manipulator for GNU/Linux)

AcetoneISO is a feature-rich and complete software application
to manage CD/DVD images. AcetoneISO will let You mount typical
proprietary images formats of the Windows world such as ISO BIN
NRG MDF IMG and do plenty of other things.

Some features you can see in /usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION/FEATURES.

For image conversion you would need PowerISO which can be
found in  https://www.poweriso.com/poweriso-1.3.tar.gz
extract and put it in $HOME/.acetoneiso

If for some reason cdrtools doesn't work with acetoneiso
use cdrkit from SBo and uninstall cdrtools.

xorriso comes with Slackware so there is no need to install
it from AlienBob's repository
