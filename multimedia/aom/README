AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an Open Source video codec designed for
video transmission over the Internet. AV1 is planned to surpass
VP9 and also to eventually be a competitor with HEVC/H.265.

This script builds the encoder aomenc, the decoder aomdec as well
as shared libraries which can be utilised by recent versions of
both FFmpeg and vlc.

Note: 'aom' replaces and upgrades 'libaom'; make sure 'libaom' is
removed before using this SlackBuild.
