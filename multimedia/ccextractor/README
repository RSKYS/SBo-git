CCExtractor is a tool that analyzes video files and produces
independent subtitle files from the closed captions data. CCExtractor
is portable, small, and very fast.  Notable features include the 
ability to extract subtitles in real-time, translate subtitles, 
extract closed captions from DVDs, and convert closed captions
to subtitles.  

By default only build the CLI version of ccextractor.  If you would
like to also build the GUI version, then install glfw3 available
here at SBo and run the script like so

GUI=yes ./ccextractor.SlackBuild
