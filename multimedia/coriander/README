Coriander is a full-featured graphical interface for controlling digital
cameras through the IEEE-1394 bus (i.e. FireWire or iLink). It can also
record videos, send images to an FTP site and convert videos to V4L
streams. A live display is also provided. The program will work with any
camera that is compatible with the IIDC specifications (v1.04 or later):
this includes most 1394 webcams and many industrial and scientific
cameras.

NOTE - ftplib can be omitted if FTP support is not needed: Coriander
will build just fine.
