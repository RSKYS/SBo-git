Cowbell is an elegant, album-based, music organizer written by Brad
Taylor in C# for Gtk+. Using TagLib, it supports many audio formats
including:
- Ogg/FLAC
- MP3
- MusePack

Cowbell is tightly integrated with Amazon.com using its free SOAP
service. Cowbell  employs this service not only to fetch album cover
images, as most tag editors do, but also in combination with intelligent
algorithms to "guess" the appropriate song information from song titles.
It can also cache these cover images in the same directory where that
album resides.

For you console junkies, Cowbell also offers a command-line based batch
tagger which can tag and "guess" a whole collection of music with just a
few keystrokes.
