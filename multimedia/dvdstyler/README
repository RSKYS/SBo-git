DVDStyler is a cross-platform free DVD authoring application for the
creation of professional-looking DVDs. It allows not only burning of
video files on DVD that can be played practically on any standalone
DVD player, but also creation of individually designed DVD menus.

When launched the application will look for a ~/.dvdstyler
directory where to save its own preferences: if the directory is not
present the application will start but will segfault when quitting,
not saving any preferences.
Upstream has been notified but in the meantime the workaround is to
manually create the ~/.dvdstyler directory (sorry for the hassle)
