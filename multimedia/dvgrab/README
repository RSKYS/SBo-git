dvgrab receives audio and video data from a digital camcorder via an
IEEE1394 (widely known as FireWire) link and stores them into one of
several file formats. It features autosplit of long video sequences,
and supports saving the data as raw frames, AVI type 1, AVI type 2,
Quicktime DV, or a series of JPEG stills.

libquicktime is an optional dependency.
