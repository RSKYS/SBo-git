filebot-4.7 (The ultimate TV and Movie Renamer)

FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your movies,
tv shows, anime, and music, as well as downloading subtitles and
artwork. It's smart and just works.

Many examples of renaming conventions, including automating renaming,
can be found on their website and forum.

If desired, other JDKs can be substituted.

This is the last free version of filebot. 4.8+ require a paid license
to be able to use. This version is unmaintained and is at least
partially broken. I know TheTVDB.com support is no longer working due
to API changes. It is provided as-is, for those not wanting to move
to the paid version.

You are unable to install this with the updated version of filebot.
