filebot (The ultimate TV and Movie Renamer)

FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your movies,
tv shows, anime, and music, as well as downloading subtitles and
artwork. It's smart and just works.

Many examples of renaming conventions, including automating renaming,
can be found on their website and forum.

If desired, openjdk can be substituted for jdk.
