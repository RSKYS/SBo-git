FreeTube (The Private YouTube Client)

FreeTube is a YouTube client for Windows, Mac, and Linux built around
using YouTube more privately. You can enjoy your favorite content and 
creators without your habits being tracked. All of your user data is 
stored locally and never sent or published to the internet. FreeTube 
grabs data by scraping the information it needs (with either local 
methods or by optionally utilizing the Invidious API). With many 
features similar to YouTube, FreeTube has become one of the best 
methods to watch YouTube privately on desktop.
