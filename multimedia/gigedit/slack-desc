# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gigedit: gigedit allows you to edit and create instruments for the Gigasampler
gigedit: format, which can be used with LinuxSampler as well as with Tascam's
gigedit: Gigastudio. Following our line of modularity we also made the
gigedit: instrument editors independent applications.
