GIMP-GAP (GIMP Animation Package), is a collection of plug-ins
to extend GIMP 2.6 and above with capabilities to edit and create
animations as sequences of single frames.

By default, the script will try to detect all optional requirements.
In case you don't have those requirements, you can disable it by
passing variables to the script (VAR=yes/no ./gimp-gap.SlackBuild):
FAAC=yes|no (default: yes), requires faac
FAAD=yes|no (default: yes), requires faad2
X264=yes|no (default: yes), requires x264
MPEG=yes|no (default: yes), requires libmpeg
XVID=yes|no (default: yes), requires xvidcore

NOTE: If you build this package using internal ffmpeg package,
you need to remove the "#" character in line 102
