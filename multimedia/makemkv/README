MakeMKV converts video that you own into a free and patents-
unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. It converts the
video clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) discs into a set
of MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it in any
way. MakeMKV can also instantly stream decrypted video without
intermediate conversion to a wide range of players, so you may watch
Blu-ray and DVD discs with your favorite player on your favorite OS
or on your favorite device.

This package can optionally spoof libaacs and libbdplus, decrypting
discs through MakeMKV instead. To enable this, pass FAKELIBS=yes
to the script. Installing such a package will override existing
libaacs and libbdplus libraries; if you choose to spoof them, the
real libraries should not be installed.

Note that recent versions of MakeMKV may require loading the 'sg' kernel
module to properly detect your optical drive. You may wish to add the
following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local:

    /sbin/modprobe sg
