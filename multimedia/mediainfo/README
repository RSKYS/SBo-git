MediaInfo supplies technical and tag information about a video or
audio file.

It will build the CLI version by default, however, you can optionally
build mediainfo-gui by passing GUI=yes to the SlackBuild script, or
you can disable the CLI version by passing CLI=no. Either the CLI
or GUI verison must be enabled.

GUI=yes requires wxPython.
