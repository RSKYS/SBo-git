munt (Roland MIDI device emulator)

Munt is a multi-platform software synthesizer emulating (somewhat
inaccurately) pre-GM MIDI devices such as the Roland MT-32, CM-32L,
CM-64 and LAPC-1.

A few ROMS for these devices are included: the v1.07 ROM for the MT-32
and the v1.02 ROM for the CM-32L. The applications have been patched
to use the packaged ROMs by default, though you can use other ROMs
easily enough.

This will install the desktop applications (mt32emu-qt and xmt32), the
command-line tools (mt32emu-smf2wav and mt32d), the shared library,
and the headers.

Optional dependency: jack (autodetected). If jack is present,
munt will be built with support for it. If this package is built
with jack, it uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
