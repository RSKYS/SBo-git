.SH NAME
pesvideo2ts \- tool from openCaster suite
.SH DESCRIPTION
Usage: 'pesvideo2ts pid es_framerate[:pcr_rate] es_video_vbv ts_video_bitrate loop_on input1.pes [input2.pes ... input256.pes]'
 where pid is bounded from 1 to 8191
 es_framerate is elementary stream frame rate
 pcr_rate is pcr insertion repetetion in milliseconds
 es_video_vbv is elementary stream vbv size example: 112 are vbv units (16 * 1024 bit), b1024 is 1024 bit 
 ts_video_bitrate is the output bitrate desired
 if loop_on is 1 input file are read on loop, works only for mpeg2 video files
 if the first file of the loop is missing the loop ends
 more than 1 file is only for mpeg2 videos
 input files can be changed at runtime if not fifo
framerate available are 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 50, 59 and 60
29 is actually 30000รท1001 as from standard and so on
