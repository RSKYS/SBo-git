OpenShot Video Editor is a free, open-source, non-linear video editor.
It can create and edit videos and movies using many popular video,
audio, and image formats.

Blender is an optional runtime dependency (for animated titles),
as is inkscape. To use them, set the full paths for the blender and
inkscape executables in the preferences menu.
