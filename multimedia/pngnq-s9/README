pngnq-s9 is a modified version of pngnq, the neural network colour
quantizer for png images.

pngnq-s9 adds several new options to pngnq including the ability to
augment a user-supplied palette, the ability to quantize in the YUV
colour space, and the ability to give more or less weight to specific
components when quantizing.
