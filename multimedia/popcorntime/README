Popcorn Time is a multi-platform, open source BitTorrent client 
that includes an integrated media player. The program is a free 
alternative to subscription-based video streaming services such 
as Netflix. Popcorn Time uses sequential downloading to play 
copies of films listed by the website yts.to, also known as YIFY 
(although other trackers can be added and used manually).
