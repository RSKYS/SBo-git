Serviio DNLA Server is a free media server. It allows you to stream 
your media files (music, video or images) to renderer devices (e.g. a 
TV set, Bluray player, games console or mobile phone) on your connected 
home network.

There is also a paid for Pro edition which further enhances the 
possibilities of sharing content in your connected household. If you 
don't buy a Pro edition licence, Serviio automatically will turn to 
Free version after 14 days. This SlackBuild provides no Pro edition 
licence.

Serviio works with many devices from your connected home (TV, 
Playstation 3, XBox 360, smart phones, tablets, etc.). It supports 
profiles for particular devices so that it can be tuned to maximise the 
device's potential and/or minimize lack of media format playback 
support (via transcoding).

Serviio needs a serviio user and a serviio group with GID=337 and
UID=337 to work properly. Run these commands:

  groupadd -g 337 serviio
  useradd -d /opt/serviio -g 337 -u 337 -U serviio

This SlackBuild also provides a /etc/rc.d/rc.serviio file. If you want 
to start Serviio at boot time, add these lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  # start Serviio DNLA Server:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.serviio] ; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.serviio start
  fi

Also, add to rc.local_shutdown

  # stop Serviio DNLA Server
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.serviio] ; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.serviio start
  fi
