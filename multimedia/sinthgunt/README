Sinthgunt is an open source graphical user interface for
ffmpeg, a computer program that can convert digital audio and
video into numerous formats. Using the pre-configured conversion
settings file /usr/share/sinthgunt/presets.xml, it makes
the task of converting between different media formats very easy.
