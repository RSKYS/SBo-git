An open source solution to make a movie out of still pictures, 
stills can be of any resolution (highest preferably for best 
results). The output also could be of any resolution, from a 
small video for youtube to a full HD (or more if you know what 
you're doing). Since we now can make JPGs for ffmpeg and 
mencoder as well as PPMs for encodedv this application could 
also be called; stills2mpeg 

ffmpeg is an optional dependency (it can use the already
present mencoder).
