# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

stills2dv: stills2dv (make movies from still images)
stills2dv:
stills2dv: stills2dv is an open source solution to make a movie out of still
stills2dv: pictures; stills can be of any resolution (highest preferably for
stills2dv: best results). The output also could be of any resolution, from a
stills2dv: small video for youtube to a full HD (or more if you know what
stills2dv: you're doing). Since we now can make JPGs for ffmpeg and mencoder as
stills2dv: well as PPMs for encodedv this application  could also be called
stills2dv: stills2mpeg
