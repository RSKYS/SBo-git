A Chromecast media streamer for Linux.
Stream2Chromecast casts audio and video files to a Chromecast device
from Linux. It can also transcode any unsupported files in real time
and play them on the Chromecast. It is written in Python 2.7 and uses
either ffmpeg or avconv for transcoding.

Transcoding depends on ffmpeg with aac support, which is not currently
enabled, so this won't work out of the box.
