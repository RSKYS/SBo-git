.SH NAME
es2ts \- convert ES to TS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B es2ts
[\fIswitches\fR] \fI<infile>\fR \fI<outfile>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
TS tools version 1.11, es2ts built Nov 11 2008 17:15:46
.IP
Convert an elementary video stream to H.222 transport stream.
Supports input streams conforming to MPEG\-2 (H.262), MPEG\-4/AVC
(H.264) and AVS. Also supports MPEG\-1 input streams, insofar as MPEG\-2
is backwards compatible with MPEG\-1.
.IP
Note that this program works by reading and packaging the elementary
stream packages directly \- it does not parse them as H.262 or H.264
data.
.SS "Files:"
.TP
<infile>
is a file containing the Elementary Stream data
(but see \fB\-stdin\fR below)
.TP
<outfile>
is an H.222 Transport Stream file
(but see \fB\-stdout\fR and \fB\-host\fR below)
.SS "Switches:"
.TP
\fB\-pid\fR <pid>
<pid> is the video PID to use for the data.
Use '\-pid 0x<pid>' to specify a hex value.
Defaults to 0x68.
.TP
\fB\-pmt\fR <pid>
<pid> is the PMT PID to use.
Use '\-pmt 0x<pid>' to specify a hex value.
Defaults to 0x66
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Output summary information about each ES packet
as it is read
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Only output error messages
.TP
\fB\-stdin\fR
Take input from <stdin>, instead of a named file
.TP
\fB\-stdout\fR
Write output to <stdout>, instead of a named file
Forces \fB\-quiet\fR.
.TP
\fB\-host\fR <host>, \fB\-host\fR <host>:<port>
Writes output (over TCP/IP) to the named <host>,
instead of to a named file. If <port> is not
specified, it defaults to 88.
.TP
\fB\-max\fR <n>, \fB\-m\fR <n>
Maximum number of ES data units to read
.SS "Stream type:"
.IP
When the TS data is being output, it is flagged to indicate whether
it conforms to H.262, H.264 or AVS. It is important to get this right,
as it will affect interpretation of the TS data.
.IP
If input is from a file, then the program will look at the start of
the file to determine if the stream is H.264, H.262 or AVS. This
process may occasionally come to the wrong conclusion, in which case
the user can override the choice using the following switches.
.IP
If input is from standard input (via \fB\-stdin\fR), then it is not possible
for the program to make its own decision on the input stream type.
Instead, it defaults to H.262, and relies on the user indicating if
this is wrong.
.TP
\fB\-h264\fR, \fB\-avc\fR
Force the program to treat the input as MPEG\-4/AVC.
.TP
\fB\-h262\fR
Force the program to treat the input as MPEG\-2.
.TP
\fB\-avs\fR
Force the program to treat the input as AVS.
