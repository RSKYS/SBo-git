.SH NAME
esreport \- Report the content of a video ES
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B esreport
[\fIswitches\fR] \fI<infile>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
TS tools version 1.11, esreport built Nov 11 2008 17:15:46
.IP
Report on the content of an elementary stream containing H.264
(MPEG\-4/AVC), H.262 (MPEG\-2) or AVS video data.
.SS "Files:"
.TP
<infile>
is the Elementary Stream file (but see \fB\-stdin\fR below)
.SS "What to report:"
.IP
The default is to report on H.262 items, AVS frames or H.264 NAL units.
Other choices are:
.TP
\fB\-frames\fR
Report by frames. The default for AVS.
.TP
\fB\-findfields\fR
Report on any fields in the data. Ignored for AVS.
.TP
\fB\-afd\fR
Report (just) on AFD changes in H.262. Ignored for the
other types of file.
.TP
\fB\-es\fR
Report on ES units.
.IP
Reporting on frames may be modified by:
.TP
\fB\-framesize\fR
Report on the sizes of frames (mean, etc.).
.TP
\fB\-frametype\fR
Report on the numbers of different type of frame.
.IP
(in fact, both of these imply \fB\-frame\fR).
.SS "Other switches:"
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
For H.262 data, output information about the data
in each MPEG\-2 item. For ES units, output information
about the data in each ES unit. Ignored for H.264 data.
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Only output summary information (i.e., the number
of entities in the file, statistics, etc.)
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Show details of each NAL unit as it is read.
.TP
\fB\-stdin\fR
Take input from <stdin>, instead of a named file
.TP
\fB\-max\fR <n>, \fB\-m\fR <n>
Maximum number of NAL units/MPEG\-2 items/AVS frames/ES units
to read. If \fB\-frames\fR, then the program will stop after
that many frames. If reading 'frames', MPEG\-2 and AVS will
also count sequence headers and sequence end.
.TP
\fB\-pes\fR, \fB\-ts\fR
The input file is TS or PS, to be read via the
PES\->ES reading mechanisms
.TP
\fB\-pesreport\fR
Report on PES headers. Implies \fB\-pes\fR and \fB\-q\fR.
.SS "Stream type:"
.IP
If input is from a file, then the program will look at the start of
the file to determine if the stream is H.264, H.262 or AVS data. This
process may occasionally come to the wrong conclusion, in which case
the user can override the choice using the following switches.
.IP
If input is from standard input (via \fB\-stdin\fR), then it is not possible
for the program to make its own decision on the input stream type.
Instead, it defaults to H.262, and relies on the user indicating if
this is wrong.
.TP
\fB\-h264\fR, \fB\-avc\fR
Force the program to treat the input as MPEG\-4/AVC.
.TP
\fB\-h262\fR
Force the program to treat the input as MPEG\-2.
.TP
\fB\-avs\fR
Force the program to treat the input as AVS.
