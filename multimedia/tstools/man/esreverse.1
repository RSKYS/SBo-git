.SH NAME
esreverse \- reverse an es stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B esreverse
[\fIswitches\fR] \fI<infile>\fR \fI<outfile>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
TS tools version 1.11, esreverse built Nov 11 2008 17:15:47
.IP
Output a reversed stream derived from the input H.264 (MPEG\-4/AVC)
or H.262 (MPEG\-2) elementary stream.
.IP
If output is to an H.222 Transport Stream, then fixed values for
the PMT PID (0x66) and video PID (0x68) are used.
.SS "Files:"
.TP
<infile>
is the input elementary stream.
.IP
<outfile> is the output stream, either an equivalent elementary
.IP
stream, or an H.222 Transport Stream (but see \fB\-stdout\fR
and \fB\-host\fR below).
.SS "Switches:"
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Output additional (debugging) messages
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Only output error messages
.TP
\fB\-stdout\fR
Write output to <stdout>, instead of a named file
Forces \fB\-quiet\fR.
.TP
\fB\-host\fR <host>, \fB\-host\fR <host>:<port>
Writes output (over TCP/IP) to the named <host>,
instead of to a named file. If <port> is not
specified, it defaults to 88. Implies \fB\-tsout\fR.
.TP
\fB\-max\fR <n>, \fB\-m\fR <n>
Maximum number of frames to read
.TP
\fB\-freq\fR <n>
Specify the frequency of frames to try to keep
when reversing. Defaults to 8.
.TP
\fB\-tsout\fR
Output H.222 Transport Stream
.TP
\fB\-pes\fR, \fB\-ts\fR
The input file is TS or PS, to be read via the
PES\->ES reading mechanisms
.TP
\fB\-server\fR
Also output as normal forward video as reversal
data is being collected. Implies \fB\-pes\fR and \fB\-tsout\fR.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
Temporary extra debugging information
.SS "Stream type:"
.IP
If input is from a file, then the program will look at the start of
the file to determine if the stream is H.264 or H.262 data. This
process may occasionally come to the wrong conclusion, in which case
the user can override the choice using the following switches.
.TP
\fB\-h264\fR, \fB\-avc\fR
Force the program to treat the input as MPEG\-4/AVC.
.TP
\fB\-h262\fR
Force the program to treat the input as MPEG\-2.
.IP
