.SH NAME
stream_type \- attempt to determine if an input stream is TS, PS, or ES
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stream_type
[\fIswitches\fR] \fI<infile>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
TS tools version 1.11, stream_type built Nov 11 2008 17:15:48
.IP
Attempt to determine if an input stream is Transport Stream,
Program Stream, or Elementary Stream, and if the latter, if it
is H.262 or H.264 (i.e., MPEG\-2 or MPEG\-4/AVC respectively).
The mechanisms used are fairly crude, assuming that:
\- data is byte aligned
\- for TS, the first byte in the file will be the start of a NAL unit,
.IP
and PAT/PMT packets will be findable
.IP
\- for PS, the first packet starts immediately at the start of the
.IP
file, and is a pack header
.IP
\- if the first 1000 packets could be H.262 *or* H.264, then the data
.IP
is assumed to be H.264 (the program doesn't try to determine
sensible sequences of H.262/H.264 packets, so this is a reasonable
way of guessing)
.IP
It is quite possible that data which is not relevant will be
misidentified
.IP
The program exit value is:
*  10 if it detects Transport Stream,
*  11 if it detects Program Stream,
*  12 if it detects Elementary Stream containing H.262 (MPEG\-2),
*  14 if it detects Elementary Stream containing H.264 (MPEG\-4/AVC),
*  5 if it looks like it might be PES,
*  9 if it really cannot decide, or
*  0 if some error occurred
