.SH NAME
tsreport \- report on a Transport Stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsreport
[\fIswitches\fR] \fI<infile>\fR [\fIswitches\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
TS tools version 1.11, tsreport built Nov 11 2008 17:15:48
.IP
Report on one of the following for the given Transport Stream:
.IP
* The number of TS packets.
* PCR and PTS/DTS differences (\fB\-buffering\fR).
* The packets of a single PID (\fB\-justpid\fR).
.IP
When conflicting switches are specified, the last takes effect.
.SS "Input:"
.TP
<infile>
Read data from the named H.222 Transport Stream file
.TP
\fB\-stdin\fR
Read data from standard input
.SS "Normal operation:"
.IP
By default, normal operation just reports the number of TS packets.
.TP
\fB\-timing\fR, \fB\-t\fR       Report timing information based on the PCRs
.TP
\fB\-data\fR             Show TS packet/payload data as bytes
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR      Also output (fairly detailed) information on each TS packet
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR        Only output summary information (this is the default)
.TP
\fB\-max\fR <n>, \fB\-m\fR <n>  Maximum number of TS packets to read
.SS "Buffering information:"
.TP
\fB\-buffering\fR, \fB\-b\fR
Report on the differences between PCR and PTS, and
between PCR and DTS. This is relevant to the size of
buffers needed in the decoder.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR <file>
Output CSV data for \fB\-buffering\fR to the named file.
.TP
\fB\-32\fR
Truncate 33 bit values in the CSV output to 32 bits
(losing the top bit).
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Output PCR/PTS/DTS information as it is found (in a
format similar to that used for \fB\-o\fR)
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Output less information (notably, not the PMT)
.TP
\fB\-cnt\fR <pid>,
Check values of continuity_counter in the specified PID.
Writes all the values of the counter to a file called
\&'continuity_counter.txt'. Turns buffering on (\fB\-b\fR).
.TP
\fB\-max\fR <n>, \fB\-m\fR <n>
Maximum number of TS packets to read
.SS "Single PID:"
.TP
\fB\-justpid\fR <pid>
Just show data (file offset, index, adaptation field
and payload) for TS packets with the given PID.
PID 0 is allowed (i.e., the PAT).
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Is ignored
.TP
\fB\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
Is ignored
.TP
\fB\-max\fR <n>, \fB\-m\fR <n>
Maximum number of TS packets of that PID to read
.PP
Experimental control of timestamp formats (this doesn't affect the output
to the CVS file, produced with \fB\-o\fR):
.TP
\fB\-tfmt\fR <thing>
Specify format of time differences.
.TP
\fB\-tafmt\fR <thing>
Specify format of absolute times.
.IP
<thing> is (currently, but may change) one of:
.TP
90
Default \fB\-\-\fR show as 90KHz timestamps (suffix 't' on
the values: e.g., 4362599t).
.TP
27
Show as 27MHz timestamps (similar, e.g., 25151:000t).
.TP
32
Show as 90KHz timestamps, but only the low 32 bits.
.TP
ms
Show as milliseconds.
.TP
hms
Show as hours/minutes/seconds (H:MM:SS.ssss, the H
can be more than one digit if necessary)
