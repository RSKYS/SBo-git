Changelog for the uavs3e SlackBuild script.
--------------------------------------------------

03/09/2022:

Added to SBo.

06/02/2023:

When compiling on 32-bit systems you will run
into an error during the linking stage with
the error being: undefined reference to
_mm_extract_epi64, even if you patched the
CMakeLists.txt and adding the CFLAGS not
to detect the AVX2 and SSE4.1 flags it will not
work because then you will have another error-
incompatible types when initializing  type _m128i
using type 'int' in the file cost_avx2.c in the
src directory.So in short uavs3e is not
supported on x86 or ARM-32 bit architecture.
patched the CMakeLists to set the libdir properly.
