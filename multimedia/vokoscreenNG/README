vokoscreenNG is an easy to use screencast creator to record educational
videos, live recordings of browser, installation, videoconferences, etc.

This application requires that $XDG_SESSION_TYPE be exported with either
"X11" or "Wayland".  This SlackBuild installs profile scripts under
/etc/profile.d to set this variable.  These scripts use the value of
XDG_SESSION_TYPE from the environment in which this SlackBuild is run,
defaulting to XDG_SESSION_TYPE=X11.

To control the session type, run this script with your preferred
definition of XDG_SESSION_TYPE:

  XDG_SESSION_TYPE=Wayland ./vokoscreenNG.SlackBuild
