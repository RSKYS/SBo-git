WinFF is a GUI for the command line video converter, FFMPEG. It will
convert most any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does
multiple files in multiple formats at one time. You can for example
convert mpeg's, flv's, and mov's, all into avi's all at once.

lazarus is just a build-time dependency.

NOTE:
If you have a previous ~/.winff directory you might want to
remove it or your presets might not be updated.

WinFF is no longer maintained by the original author.It is currently
maintained by Debian maintainer Paul Gevers  and the website winff.org
has been hijacked see the following post for details.
https://github.com/WinFF/winff/issues/250

I've patched link for the FFmpeg Windows build website in the about
section to point it to correct website as mentioned in the FFmpeg
Website. see the following link for details.
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows

The Launchpad link no longer works and i've patched it to
point to the winff debian maintainer's [Paul Gevers] page.
I've made sure other websites link to https version.

There was also an issue with opening the documetation in slackware,
The paths to the documetation is hardcoded in the source file.
I've patched it to look in the /usr/doc/$PRGNAM-$VERSION folder

The default pdf viewer is xpdf. It is hardcoded in the
source file.If Xpdf is not present in the system it will
not open pdf documentation.
