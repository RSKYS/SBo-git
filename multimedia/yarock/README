Yarock is a modern looking music player, packed with features, 
that doesn't depend on any specific desktop environment. 
Yarock is designed to provide an easy and pretty music browser 
based on cover art.

NOTE:
You can build yarock with alternate audio engine (phonon is the default one).
If you want to disable phonon just use -DENABLE_PHONON=OFF as cmake option.
For vlc audio engine -DENABLE_VLC=ON.
For mpv audio engine -DENABLE_MPV=ON.
