# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

2ping: 2ping (bi-directional ping utility)
2ping:
2ping: 2ping is a bi-directional ping utility. It uses 3-way pings (akin to
2ping: TCP SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) and after-the-fact state comparison between
2ping: a 2ping listener and a 2ping client to determine which direction
2ping: packet loss occurs.
