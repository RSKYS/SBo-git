FireWorks is a free, open-source code for defining, managing, and 
executing scientific workflows. It can be used to automate calculations
over arbitrary computing resources, including those that have a
queueing system.

Some features that distinguish FireWorks are the capability to program
dynamic workflows and built-in tools for running high-throughput 
computations at large computing centers.
