# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

aiccu: Information & Control protocol), which it uses for retrieving the
aiccu: tunnel configuration information, AYIYA, which allows tunnels to be
aiccu: created even behind firewalls and NAT's.
