aircrack-ng is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks.
It consists of 802.11 packet capture and injection programs,
an utility for static WEP and WPA-PSK cracking and tools which
handle (decrypt, convert, merge, etc.) WEP/WPA capture files.

Some tools are still experimental, and are not built by default.
To build them run the SlackBuild script like this:

    AIRCRACK_EXPERIMENTAL=yes ./aircrack-ng.SlackBuild

hwloc is an optional dependency that may improve performance on
SMP systems.
