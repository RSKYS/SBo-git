This is a Slackbuild packaging of the Argus network auditing suite. 
Argus has two packages, "argus", which includes the monitoring agent 
and "argus-clients", which includes all the tools you need to analyze 
Argus output.  Similarly, I've created separate Slackbuilds; you will 
almost certainly also want to install "argus", possibly on some other 
machine.
