This is a Slackbuild packaging of the Argus network auditing suite. 
Argus has two packages, "argus", which includes the monitoring agent, 
and "argus-clients", which includes all the tools you need to analyze 
Argus output. Similarly, I've create separate Slackbuilds; you will 
almost certainly also want to install argus-clients, possibly on some 
other machine.

The package is built with the standard Slackbuilds autoconf-configure
parameters.  The package uses the contributed init script for the argus
daemon with a couple of slight modifications.  First, the init script
doesn't test whether your interface is up before starting.  Also, I've
patched the script not to put the interface into promiscuous mode by
default.

By default, output is recorded to /var/log/argus/argus.out and is not
automatically rotated.
