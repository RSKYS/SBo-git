atftp (a client/server implementation of the TFTP protocol)

atftp is a client/server implementation of the TFTP protocol that
implements RFCs 1350, 2090, 2347, 2348, and 2349. The server is
multi-threaded and the client presents a friendly interface using
libreadline.

The atftpd server supports regular expressions, e.g. to serve the same
files to a group of hosts whose hostnames/IDs match a pattern. Multicast
is also supported (though experimental).

Slackware-specific info:

This build doesn't conflict with Slackware's tftp-hpa package. To run an
atftp service via inetd, edit /etc/inetd.conf, find the line for tftp,
make sure it's commented out, and add this line below it:

tftp dgram udp wait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/atftpd /tftpboot

You may add other arguments to the above, as needed (see atftpd(8)).
Don't forget to restart inetd after editing its config (killall -HUP
inetd should do).

Note: The FAQ supplied with atftp says to use /usr/sbin/in.tftpd. With
this build of atftp, that's incorrect: in.tftpd is still the regular
Slackware TFTP daemon.

Unlike stock in.tftpd, atftp supports tcpwrappers, so you may have to
add lines to /etc/hosts.allow and/or /etc/hosts.deny. The service
name to use is "in.tftpd", *not* "atftpd"

If you want to run atftpd as a standalone daemon (not via inetd),
the easiest way to do this would be to add a line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local,
like so:

/usr/sbin/atftpd --daemon /tftpboot

...with whatever other options seem useful (--pidfile, for instance).
