Axel accelerates the HTTP/FTP downloading process by using multiple
connections for one file. It can use multiple mirrors for a download.
Axel has no dependencies and is lightweight, so it might be useful as a
wget clone on byte-critical systems. Axel is the perfect utility for
those connections to wherever you are downloading from that may have a
limit on ftp stream speeds, http sessions that burst and slow down, or
servers with a slow connection.
