Barnyard2 is a fork of the original barnyard project, designed 
specifically for Snort's new unified2 file format.  It is a 
critical tool for the parsing of Snort's binary log files to a 
variety of output plugins, capable of asynchronous processing,
while Snort continues it's job.

See README.SLACKWARE for some instructions on setting up Barnyard2.
