BASE is the Basic Analysis and Security Engine.  It is based on code 
from the Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) project.
This application provides a web frontend to query and analyze the alerts
coming from a Snort IDS system.

See the included README.SLACKWARE for information on setting up BASE.
