Basilisk is a free and Open Source XUL-based web browser, featuring
the well-known Firefox-style interface and operation. It is based on
the Goanna layout and rendering engine (a fork of Gecko) and builds
on the Unified XUL Platform (UXP), which in turn is a fork of the
Mozilla code base without Servo or Rust.

Basilisk is community software released by the Pale Moon team and
Mozilla developers.

This SlackBuild just repackages the binary package provided by the
project. It doesn't attempt to build the browser from source.

The Basilisk Linux packages are currently only 64-bit.
