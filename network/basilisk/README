Basilisk (Web browser -- BUILD FROM SOURCE)

Note: this builds Basilisk from source and conflicts with the binary
repackage also found on SBo.

Basilisk is a demonstration program for the Unified XUL Platform (XUP).
It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

Some build time options:

  GTK=gtk2 ./basilisk.SlackBuild

will override the default and build with gtk2 instead of gtk3.

jack is an optional dependency and, if detected, automatically built. If
this is undesirable you can blacklist jack, by passing the variable:

  BLACKLIST_JACK=yes ./basilisk.SlackBuild
