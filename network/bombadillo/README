Bombadillo is a non-web browser, designed for a growing list of
protocols operating outside of the web.

Bombadillo is operated from your terminal, allowing you to browse
content, follow links, and engage in the non-web with ease.
The main features of Bombadillo are:
 - Seamless browsing between multiple protocols, including Gopher,
Gemini, Finger, and your local file system
 - Additional support for telnet and the web through third-party
applications - http/https connection support is opt-in, and is
configurable in a few different ways
 - Privacy focused - does not store usage or browsing data, will only
store items you instruct it to (bookmarks, gemini certificates,
settings and downloaded files)
 - Does not send/transmit anything to anyone that you do not instruct
it to
 - Uses Vi/Vim-inspired keybindings and an easy command system
 - Navigable history within a session (no storage of session data)
 - Supports bookmarks
 - Gemini Protocol support includes secure communication over TLS,
and uses a TOFU-style certificate system
