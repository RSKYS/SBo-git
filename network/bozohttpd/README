bozohttpd (simple and lightweight HTTP server)

bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP version 1.1 server. Its main
feature is the lack of features, reducing the code size and improving
verifiability. It supports CGI/1.1, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.9, ~user
translations, virtual hosting support, as well as multiple IP-based
servers on a single machine. It is capable of serving pages via the
IPv6 protocol. bozohttpd features SSL support. By design, there is no
configuration file: all options are provided as command-line arguments.

bozohttpd is mainly intended to be run via inetd (see bozohttpd(8)),
but is capable of running as a standalone daemon (the -b option). There
is no startup script for daemon mode, but you can launch bozohttpd
from /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

bozohttpd has several features that can be disabled at compile time,
to reduce the binary size and/or to avoid security issues (features
that aren't included can't be exploited). See the file defines.default
for details on how to do this. By default, all features are enabled
(except maybe lua; see below).

Optional dependency: lua.

bozohttpd can be built with support for dynamic content using
Lua. This isn't needed for running CGI scripts that happen to be
written in Lua.  It's for embedding a Lua interpreter in bozohttpd,
in the style of Apache's mod_php or mod_perl. If lua is installed, it
will be autodetected.  If you want to build without it, export LUA=no
in the environment.

Without Lua support, the -L option to bozohttpd will not work.
