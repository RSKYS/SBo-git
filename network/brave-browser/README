Brave is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave
Software, Inc. based on the Chromium web browser.

The browser blocks ads and website trackers, and provides a
way for users to send cryptocurrency contributions in the
form of Basic Attention Tokens to websites and content creators.

Brave is 64-bit software.

This SlackBuild does not build Brave from source, it repackages
the binary.
