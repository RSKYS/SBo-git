# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

btpd: btpd (The BitTorrent Protocol Daemon)
btpd:
btpd: Btpd is a utility for sharing files over the BitTorrent network
btpd: protocol. It runs in daemon mode, thus needing no controlling
btpd: terminal or gui. Instead, the daemon is controlled by btcli, its
btpd: command line utility, or other programs capable of sending commands
btpd: and queries on the control socket.
