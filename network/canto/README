canto (An ncurses RSS aggregator)

Canto is an Atom/RSS feed reader for the console that is meant to be
quick, concise, and colorful.  It is meant to allow you to crank
through feeds like you've never cranked before by providing a
minimal, yet information packed interface.  An interface with almost
infinite customization and extensibility using the excellent Python
programming language.
