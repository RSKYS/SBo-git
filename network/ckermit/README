C-Kermit is a combined network and serial communication software
package offering a consistent, transport-independent, cross-platform
approach to connection establishment, terminal sessions, file
transfer, file management, character-set translation, numeric and
alphanumeric paging, and automation of file transfer and management,
dialogs, and communication tasks through its built-in scripting
language.

C-Kermit includes:

  * The fastest and most advanced implementation of the Kermit file
    transfer protocol available anywhere.
  * A powerful, portable, easy-to-use script programming language to
    automate all your routine communications tasks.
  * Consistent operation over serial connections (direct or dialed)
    and network connections on a huge selection of hardware and
    software platforms.
  * Secure authentication and strong encryption.
  * Built-in scriptable FTP and HTTP clients plus an SSH interface
  * Configurability as an SSH Subsystem
  * Character-set translation in both file transfer and online sessions,
    for Western- and Eastern-European languages, Cyrillic, Greek,
    Hebrew, and Japanese, now including Unicode.
  * Ability to send numeric and alphanumeric pages.

This SlackBuild installs a default initialization file in the
documentation directory.  However, an initialization file is rarely
required with ckermit.
