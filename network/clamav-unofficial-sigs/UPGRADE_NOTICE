If you are upgrading from verion 3.7.2 or earlier to this version:

Please make sure you backup your existing config file.  New maintainers
have done major rework with the script and config files.

All config files are now located in /etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs directory.

Be prepared to move all your configs to the new location by hand and 
to make necessary changes inside the new config.
