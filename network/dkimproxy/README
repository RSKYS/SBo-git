DKIMproxy is an SMTP-proxy that signs and/or verifies emails, using
the Mail::DKIM module. It is designed for Postfix, but should work
with any mail server. It comprises two separate proxies, an
"outbound" proxy for signing outgoing email, and an "inbound" proxy
for verifying signatures of incoming email. With Postfix, the proxies
can operate as either Before-Queue or After-Queue content filters.
DKIMproxy is written in Perl.
