# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dkimproxy: DKIMproxy uses the Mail::DKIM module. It is designed for Postfix,
dkimproxy: but should work with any mail server. It comprises two separate
dkimproxy: proxies, an "outbound" proxy for signing outgoing email, and
dkimproxy: an "inbound" proxy for verifying signatures of incoming email.
dkimproxy: With Postfix, the proxies can operate as either Before-Queue
dkimproxy: or After-Queue content filters.
