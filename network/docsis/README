docsis is a small program that can be used to generate binary
configuration files for DOCSIS-compliant cable modems.

This program is useful for people/operators using DOCSIS Cable Modems
that want to implement their own provisioning system, or for people
testing/working with DOCSIS technology in general.  Otherwise, there's
nothing you can do with it.  It is not designed for end-users.
