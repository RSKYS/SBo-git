Dogecoin (P2P electronic cash system)

Dogecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system
that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central
server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their
own money and transact directly with each other, with the help
of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

UPNP is disabled; it requires the optional dependency miniupnpc.

Package provides both dogecoin-qt (GUI) and dogecoind (CLI).
