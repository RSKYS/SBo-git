drawterm -- utility for connecting to Plan 9 and 9front systems.

Drawterm is a program which attempts to emulate various portions of
a 9front kernel and summarily connect to a 9front cpu and auth
server. 9front's fork of drawterm adds support for 9front's refined
authentication protocol, but can authenticate with less secure
Plan 9 systems using p9sk1.
