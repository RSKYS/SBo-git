# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

drawterm: drawterm (connect to Plan 9 and 9front systems)
drawterm:
drawterm: Drawterm is a program which attempts to emulate various portions of
drawterm: a 9front kernel and summarily connect to a 9front cpu and auth
drawterm: server. 9front's fork of drawterm adds support for 9front's refined
drawterm: authentication protocol, but can authenticate with less secure
drawterm: Plan 9 systems using p9sk1.
