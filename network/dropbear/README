dropbear (SSH server and client)

Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs on a
variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software,
distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly
useful for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as
wireless routers.

Please note the Dropbear distribution includes a standalone
version of OpenSSH's scp program. This slackbuild will build this
by default, thus creating a package which conflicts with OpenSSH's
scp binary. Installing this package will overwrite this file with a
symbolic link to the dropbearmulti binary, so a backup of /usr/bin/scp
will be made if it exists. After uninstalling dropbear, you can
restore the backup with 'mv /usr/bin/scp.openssh /usr/bin/scp'.

If you do not want to build the scp binary, use:

    WITH_SCP=no ./dropbear.SlackBuild
