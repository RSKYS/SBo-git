# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dsniff: dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively
dsniff: monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files,
dsniff: etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of
dsniff: network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to
dsniff: layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active
