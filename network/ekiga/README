Ekiga (formely known as GnomeMeeting) is an open source VoIP and
video conferencing application for GNOME. Ekiga uses both the H.323
and SIP protocols. It supports many audio and video codecs, and is
interoperable with other SIP compliant software and also with
Microsoft NetMeeting.

Help button is broken, which probably needs the Gnome help system.

The following options, all disabled by default, are supported. Just
set any of them to "yes" to enable the corresponding feature:
- AVAHI (requires the optional dependency avahi)
- KDE (experimental KDE support)
- KAB (experimental KAddressBook support)
- GS (experimental GStreamer support)
