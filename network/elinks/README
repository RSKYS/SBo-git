Elinks is an advanced and well-established feature-rich text mode web
(HTTP/FTP/..) browser. Elinks can render both frames and tables, is
highly customizable, and can be extended via Lua or Guile scripts. It
is very portable and runs on a variety of platforms. It also has
(very limited) JavaScript support via SpiderMonkey (js185).

There are a number of options that can be used to add support for
other protocols etc. To enable or disable an option use the following
method:

MOUSE=no ./elinks.SlackBuild

Several options can be combined together.

Contributed Patches:

Thanks goes to B. Watson for the following two patches:

No Suspend Patch

Elinks sometimes has problems resuming if it has been suspended with ^Z.
To apply a patch that disables ^Z, ^S and ^Q suspend/pause/resume keys
so that they are available to bind in elinks:

  NO_SUSPEND=yes

No Connect Patch.

Sometimes when quitting and another client is running on the same
session-ring, the process will freeze and require killing manually.
This patch solves that by making elinks use '-no-connect 1' by default.
It won't be possible to open links in new windows with this, but using
URI passing is a workaround.

  NO_CONNECT=yes

Auto-detected Dependencies:

js185: SpiderMonkey (can be turned off in options).
tre:   regexp support in searches.

Other included patches help make the internal gopher support usable.  By
default elinks will hand gopher URLs to lynx if the GOPHER option isn't
set.  Using the internal gopher client has the advantage of having
combined http and gopher bookmarks, and a more uniform interface.
