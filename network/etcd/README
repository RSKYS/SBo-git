Etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical
data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:
    Simple: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
    Secure: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
    Fast: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
    Reliable: properly distributed using Raft

Groupname and Username

You must have the 'etcd' group and user to run this script,
for example:

  groupadd -g 355 etcd
  useradd -d /var/lib/etcd -s /bin/sh -u 355 -g etcd etcd

For some basic setup instructions, check the included 'README.SBo'.
