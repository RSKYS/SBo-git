Etherpad lite is a really-real time collaborative editor spawned from
the Hell fire of Etherpad. We're reusing the well tested Etherpad
easysync library to make it really realtime. Etherpad Lite is based on
node.js so is much lighter and more stable than the original Etherpad.
Our hope is that this will encourage more users to use and install a
realtime collaborative editor. A smaller, manageable and well
documented codebase makes it easier for developers to improve the code
and contribute towards the project.
