Felinks is a maintained and up-to-date fork of ELinks, an advanced web
browser.

ELinks is an advanced and well-established feature-rich text mode web
(HTTP/FTP/..) browser. ELinks can render both frames and tables, is
highly customizable and can be extended via scripts. It is very portable
and runs on a variety of platforms.  The ELinks official website is
available at http://elinks.cz

NOTE: Felinks will conflict with Elinks, so currently only one can be
installed at a time.

There are a number of options that can be used to add support for
other protocols etc.  To enable or disable an option use the following
method:

  MOUSE=no ./elinks.SlackBuild
or
  MOUSE=no sh elinks.SlackBuild

Multiple options can be combined.
