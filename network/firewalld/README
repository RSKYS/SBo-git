Firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for
network or firewall zones to define the trust level of network
connections or interfaces. It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall
settings and for ethernet bridges and a separation of runtime and
permanent configuration options. It also provides an interface for
services or applications to add ip*tables and ebtables rules directly.
