fujinet-pc (Linux port of FujiNet firmware)

FujiNet is a network adaptor for the Atari 8-bit line of computers. It
has many features, including the ability to netboot the Atari from a
disk image on an Internet TNFS server. It's a piece of hardware which
plugs into the Atari's SIO port and connects to a wireless network.

fujinet-pc is a Linux port of the FujiNet firmware, which allows using
most of the FujiNet's features with just an SIO2PC cable and a PC.
The package contains both fujinet-pc and the Atari disk images from
the fujinet-sd-card git repo.

See https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI/fujinet-pc for the current
status of fujinet-pc. See also the FujiNet documentation wiki:

Since fujinet-pc wasn't designed to be installed systemwide on a Linux
system, this SlackBuild includes a wrapper script which allows each
user to have a fujinet-pc environment in his home directory. Simply
run "fujinet-pc" or choose FujiNet-PC from your desktop's application
menu; the ~/.fujinet-pc directory will be created and populated if it
doesn't already exist.

To exit fujinet-pc, press ^C or close the terminal it's running in.
