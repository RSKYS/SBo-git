gajim is a GTK3-based Jabber client featuring tabbed interface,
tray icon and notifications, encryption support, local link
(Zeroconf/Bonjour) and other interesting things.

Optional dependencies:
   gspell
   gst-plugins-ugly
   gst-plugins-bad-nonfree

Note that 1.5.4 is the last version to support Python 3.9, so there
will be no more updates of this slackbuild until the next Slackware
release.
