geomyidae (A small C-based gopherd)

Features:
* gopher menus (see index.gph for an example)
* dir listings (if no index.gph was found)
* cgi support (.cgi files are executed)
* search support in CGI files
* logging (-l option) and loglevels (-v option)
* optional TLS support

An rc.geomyidae is included which takes its startup options
from the $GEOMYIDAE_ARGS environmental variable. Read
/usr/doc/geomyidae-$VERSION/README for a list of the full
options.

The gph.vim ftdetect and syntax files are now installed into
/usr/share/vim/ so there is no need to copy them manually.

OPTIONAL:

libtls or libressl for TLS support and:

  TLS=yes ./geomyidae.SlackBuild
