gnirehtet is a tool that provides reverse tethering for Android

This is a repackage of the 64 bit binary supplied by upstream,
the version written in Rust.

gnirehtet requires adb as runtime dependency. adb is part of the
package android-tools on slackbuilds.org . adb must be in PATH,
so if it's not installed through the aforementioned package,
either alter PATH or drop it into the current working directory,
so gnirehtet finds it.

gnirehtet requires the Android device to be switched to
Developer Mode and have the following options switched on
(tested on a Redmi 9C NFC phone):

- USB debugging
- Install via USB
- USB debugging (Security settings)

`gnirehtet install` requires gnirehtet.apk in current directory
(I am not sure about it?)
gnirehtet.apk is packaged into /usr/share/gnirehtet/. Copy or symlink it
from there into current directory
When running `gnirehtet install`, despite having the "Install via USB"
option enabled, if adb fails, just copy `gnirehtet.apk` to the phone
and install it directly from the phone

gnirehtet-2.5 has two problems:

1. Sometimes the client (the phone) randomly disconnects. gnirehtet
prints a log message to stdout, but keeps working. The simplest
(but sometimes inconvenient) fix is to restart gnirehtet on the
desktop. This is true for both `gnirehtet run` and `gnirehtet autorun`
commands. A workaround that automates the restart of gnirehtet in
such situations is described in comments here:

https://github.com/Genymobile/gnirehtet/issues/352

2. When hitting the square soft key in Android to kill all apps that
run in background, gnirehtet gets killed too, the phone disconnects
from the server running the desktop and the problem is reduced to 1.
the workaround described there fixes 2. as well

This binary was compiled on Aug 16, 2020.
