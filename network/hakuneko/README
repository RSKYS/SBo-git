Hakuneko is a cross platform downloader for Manga and Anime
from various websites.Hakuneko was made to help users
downloading media for circumstances that require offline usage.
The philosophy is ad-hoc consumption, get it when you going to
watch it. It is not meant to be a mass downloader to stock up
thousands of chapters that are just collected and will probably
never be read.

Note:
This build will self update with changes in the master branch.

After uninstalling Hakuneko make sure to remove the following
folders $HOME/.config/hakuneko-desktop  and
$HOME/.cache/hakuneko-desktop
