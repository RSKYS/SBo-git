README.setup for havp

After installing, edit /etc/havp/havp.conf according to the comments. 
At a minimum, you'll need to pay attention to these two lines:

  # REMOVETHISLINE deleteme
  ENABLECLAMLIB true

You'll probably want to make /var/tmp/havp a ram-based filesystem, 
so something like this in /etc/fstab will suffice:

  tmpfs    /var/tmp/havp    tmpfs    mand,uid=havp,gid=clamav,mode=0775    0 0

Finally, start clamav and havp:

  /etc/rc.d/rc.clamav start
  /etc/rc.d/rc.havp start
