httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual connection tunnelled in
HTTP requests, and the HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy
if so desired.  This can be useful for users behind restrictive
firewalls. If WWW access is allowed through a HTTP proxy, it's
possible to use httptunnel and e.g. telnet or PPP to connect to
another computer outside the firewall.
