# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

httptunnel: HTTP requests, and the HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy
httptunnel: if so desired.  This can be useful for users behind restrictive
httptunnel: firewalls. If WWW access is allowed through a HTTP proxy, it's
httptunnel: possible to use httptunnel and e.g. telnet or PPP to connect to
httptunnel: another computer outside the firewall.
