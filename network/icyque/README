icyque IICQ WIM protocol for libpurple)

If you're switching to IcyQue from the built-in ICQ plugin, you'll
need to restart Pidgin and then edit your existing account (or create a
new account) with the "ICQ (WIM)" protocol.

If you only have a phone number, then enter that with a + at the
beginning and leave the password field blank.
