IP2Location C Library

IP2Location is a C library that enables the user to find the country,
region, city, latitude, longitude, zip code, time zone, ISP, domain
name, connection type, area code, weather, mobile network, elevation,
usage type by IP address or hostname originates from. The library
reads the geo location information from IP2Location BIN data file.

IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.

It contains the IP-COUNTRY BIN databases (IPv4 and IPv6) which
consists of IP address blocks as keys and countries as
values. Developers can download other sample databases to evaluate
other features such as region, city, latitude, longitude, zip code,
ISP, domain name, connection, area code, weather code, mobile network,
elevation, and usage type code using the same C library.

To install the included IP-COUNTRY BIN databases pass DB=yes to
the slackbuild as

   DB=yes ./ip2location-c.SlackBuild
