# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

iperf3: iperf3 (bandwidth measurement tool)
iperf3:
iperf3: Perf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable
iperf3: bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters
iperf3: related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP, with IPv4
iperf3: and IPv6). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other
iperf3: parameters.
iperf3:
iperf3: This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original
iperf3: iPerf and also is not backwards compatible.
