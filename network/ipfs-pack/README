IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a hypermedia p2p protocol suite
that has HTTP gateway built in.  It can be used to store any kind of
immutable datasets, organized in files, directories, and commits.

For more information, check out go-ipfs (which is central package for
IPFS, but not a direct dependency for ipfs-pack).

ipfs-pack is a tool and library to work with ipfs and large
collections of data in UNIX/POSIX filesystems.

It identifies singular collections or bundles of data (the pack).

It creates a light-weight cryptographically secure manifest that
preserves the integrity of the collection over time, and travels
with the data (PackManifest).

It helps use ipfs in a mode that references the filesystem files
directly and avoids duplicating data (filestore).

It carries a standard dataset metadata file to capture and present
information about the dataset (data-package.json).

It helps verify the authenticity of data through a file carrying
cryptographic signatures (PackAuth).
