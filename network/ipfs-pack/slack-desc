# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ipfs-pack: ipfs-pack is a tool and library to work with ipfs and large
ipfs-pack: collections of data in UNIX/POSIX filesystems. It identifies singular
ipfs-pack: collections or bundles of data (the pack), creates a light-weight
ipfs-pack: cryptographically secure manifest that preserves the integrity of the
ipfs-pack: collection over time, and travels with the data (PackManifest).
