The IPTV-Analyzer is a continuous/real-time tool for analyzing the contents
of MPEG2 Transport Stream (TS) packets, which is commonly used for IPTV
multicast signals.

The main purpose is continuous quality measurement, with a focus on detecting
MPEG2 TS/CC packet drops.

It scales to hundreds of IPTV channels, even on small ATOM based CPUs.
