ipvsadm: Admin tool for the Linux Virtual Server
  
The Linux Virtual Server is a highly scalable and highly available
server built on a cluster of real servers, with the load balancer
running on the Linux operating system. The architecture of the 
server cluster is fully transparent to end users, and the users
interact as if it were a single high-performance virtual server.
