Jitsi Meet is the Secure, Simple and Scalable Video Conferences that
you use as a standalone app or embed in your web application.
This is the Jitsi Meet desktop application, powered by Electron.

This SlackBuild repackages the upstream AppImage. The AppImage is only
available for 64-bit systems.

This is not to be confused with Jitsi Desktop (packaged as jitsi at
SlackBuilds.org), the legacy desktop application that works with
xmpp and sip servers for chat and video calls.
