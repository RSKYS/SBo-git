kNemo (KDE Network Monitor) offers a network monitor similar to the one
found in Windows.  It displays for every network interface an icon in
the systray.  Tooltips and an info dialog provide further information
about the interface.  Passive popups inform about interface changes.
A traffic plotter is also integrated.

knemo polls the network interface status every second using the ifconfig,
route, and iwconfig.
