# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libnatpmp:
libnatpmp: NAT-PMP is the direct concurrent to the UPnP IGD specification. It
libnatpmp: is providing a way to do NAT traversal. libnatpmp is an attempt to
libnatpmp: make a portable and fully compliant implementation of the protocol
libnatpmp: for the client side. It is based on non blocking sockets and all
libnatpmp: calls of the API are asynchronous. It is therefore very easy to
libnatpmp: integrate the NAT-PMP code to any event driven code.
