LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL 1.0.1g developed by the OpenBSD project.
Our goal is to modernize the codebase, improve security, and apply best
practice development processes from OpenBSD.

The binaries are installed as libressl-openssl, libressl-ocspcheck, and
libressl-nc.

************************************************************************
NOTE! This contains libtls so the standalone libtls package should be
removed before building and installing libressl.

Compatibility with OpenSSL:

LibreSSL is API compatible with OpenSSL 1.0.1, but does not yet include
all new APIs from OpenSSL 1.0.2 and later. LibreSSL also includes APIs
not yet present in OpenSSL. The current common API subset is OpenSSL
1.0.1.

LibreSSL is not ABI compatible with any release of OpenSSL, or
necessarily earlier releases of LibreSSL. You will need to relink your
programs to LibreSSL in order to use it, just as in moving between major
versions of OpenSSL.  LibreSSL's installed library version numbers are
incremented to account for ABI and API changes.

Compatibility with other operating systems:

While primarily developed on and taking advantage of APIs available on
OpenBSD, the LibreSSL portable project attempts to provide working
alternatives for other operating systems, and assists with improving
OS-native implementations where possible.

At the time of this writing, LibreSSL is known to build and work on:

* Linux (kernel 3.17 or later recommended)
* FreeBSD (tested with 9.2 and later)
* NetBSD (7.0 or later recommended)
* HP-UX (11i)
* Solaris (11 and later preferred)
* Mac OS X (tested with 10.8 and later)
* AIX (5.3 and later)

LibreSSL also supports the following Windows environments:
* Microsoft Windows (Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008r2 or later, x86 and
  x64)
* Wine (32-bit and 64-bit)
* Mingw-w64, Cygwin, and Visual Studio

Please report bugs either to the public libressl@openbsd.org mailing
list, or to the github

Severe vulnerabilities or bugs requiring coordination with OpenSSL can
be sent to the core team at libressl-security@openbsd.org.

OPTIONS:

By default a minimal set of man pages are installed:

/usr/man/man1/libressl-nc
/usr/man/man1/libressl-openssl
/usr/man/man8/libressl-ocspcheck

To install them all, use:

MANPAGES=yes ./libressl.SlackBuild

MAINTAINER NOTES

NOTE: PKG_CONFIG_PATH will likely need setting in your build scripts:

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib$LIBDIRSUFFIX/libressl/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
