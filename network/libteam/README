libteam - Library for controlling team network device

The purpose of the Team softdev Linux driver is to provide a mechanism
to team multiple NICs (ports) into one logical one (teamdev) at L2
layer. The process is called "channel bonding", "Ethernet bonding",
"channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc. This is already implemented
in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver.
