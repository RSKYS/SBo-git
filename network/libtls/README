The tls family of functions establishes a secure communications channel
using the TLS socket protocol. Both clients and servers are supported.

A TLS connection object is created by tls_client(3) or tls_server(3) and
configured with tls_configure(3).

This also includes a TLS-enabled version of netcat (libressl-nc).

NOTE! The libressl package already contains libtls.
It's recommended to uninstall this before installing libressl.
