lighttpd2 is a fast, secure, and flexible webserver. It is optimized
for high-performance environments, and provides an extensive feature 
set, including FastCGI, CGI, Auth, output compression, and URL
rewriting support.

This version currently is a work in progress: it's not ready for
production: only for interested people.


Optional Dependencies

libunwind is an optional dependency (for backtraces on assert
failures): enable it by passing the UNWIND=yes flag to the script


Groupname and Username

You must have the 'lighttpd' group and user to run this script,
for example:

  groupadd -g 208 lighttpd
  useradd -u 208 -g lighttpd -d /var/www lighttpd


Configuration

Be sure to see README.SLACKWARE (in this directory, and also installed
with the package documentation) for configuration and setup
