Supybot is a robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy to
configure) and programmer friendly (plugins are extremely easy to
write) Python IRC bot. It aims to be an adequate replacement for most
existing IRC bots. It includes a very flexible and powerful ACL
system for controlling access to commands, as well as more than 50
builtin plugins providing around 400 actual commands.

Limnoria is the project which continues development of Supybot since
2010.
