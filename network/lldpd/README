LLDP allows you to know exactly on which port is a server (and
reciprocally). It is an industry standard protocol designed to
supplant proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The goal
of LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver
Link-Layer notifications to adjacent network devices.

lldpd is an ISC-licensed implementation of LLDP for various Unixes. It
also supports some proprietary protocols.


Groupname and Username

You must have the '_lldpd' group and user to run this script,
for example:

  groupadd -g 347 _lldpd
  useradd -u 347 -d /run/lldpd -s /bin/false -g _lldpd _lldpd
