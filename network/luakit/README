luakit (micro-browser framework)

luakit is a fast, light and simple to use micro-browser framework
exensible by Lua using the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+
toolkit.

The configuration options are endless, the entire browser is
constructed by the config files present in /etc/xdg/luakit
Just copy the files you wish to change (and the rc.lua) into
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/luakit (defaults to ~/.config/luakit) and
luakit will use those files when you next launch it.

Note: lua-filesystem is required, and it must be built with
lua51 support (meaning, build/install lua51 before building
lua51). If you install the dependencies in the order listed
in the .info file, you'll be fine.

Optional dependency: luajit. To enable building luakit with luajit
support, export LUAJIT=yes in the script's environment. If you do
this, lua51 is *not* required, regardless of what the .info file says.

To enable clang instead of gcc as the compiler, use:
  CC=clang
