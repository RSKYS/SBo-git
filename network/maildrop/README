maildrop (mail delivery agent with filtering abilities)

maildrop is the mail filter/mail delivery agent that's used
by the Courier Mail Server. This is a standalone build of
the maildrop mail filter that can be used with other mail
servers. If desired it can be used as a 'drop in' replacement
for Procmail.
