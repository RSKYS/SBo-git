The Metasploit Framework is a development platform for creating
security tools and exploits. The framework is used by network security
professionals to perform penetration tests, system administrators to
verify patch installations, product vendors to perform regression
testing, and security researchers world-wide. The framework is written
in the Ruby programming language and includes components written in C
and assembler.

This is just a repackaged version of the installer you get from the
Metasploit download page. This is an all-in-one installer with
Metasploit own versions of Ruby, Java and PostgreSQL.

Take a look at README.SLACKWARE for important build requirements and
upgrading suggestions.
