Matroska Server Mk2 project is the result of years of thinking,
trying and finally succeeding.

This software makes it possible to stream (almost) anything remuxed
as matroska live in real-time over http to multiple clients.

This is probably also one of the first real world usages of FFmpeg's
http server component (which I wrote as part of GSoC 2015).
