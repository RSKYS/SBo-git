MLDonkey is an open source, free software multi-network peer-to-peer app.

By default, this SlackBuild will build MLdonkey without a GUI. Without a
GUI, you can control mldonkey by connecting to localhost:4080 with your
web browser.

If you want to build MLDonkey's GUI, you'll have to enable it with the
GUIOPT variable like this: GUIOPT=yes ./mldonkey.SlackBuild

Be sure not to have ocaml and lablgtk already installed when compiling
this as build may break (mldonkey seems to need its own versions of the
above dependencies).
