# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mod_auth_gssapi: mod_auth_gssapi (GSSAPI Negotiate module for Apache)
mod_auth_gssapi:
mod_auth_gssapi: The mod_auth_gssapi is an Apache module designed to provide Kerberos
mod_auth_gssapi: authentication to the Apache HTTP Server. This module has been built
mod_auth_gssapi: as a replacement for the aging mod_auth_kerb. Its aim is to use only
mod_auth_gssapi: GSSAPI calls and be as much as possible agnostic of the actual
mod_auth_gssapi: mechanism used.
