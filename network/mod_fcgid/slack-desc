# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mod_fcgid: mod_fcgid (FastCGI interface module for Apache 2)
mod_fcgid:
mod_fcgid: mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
mod_fcgid: which starts a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to
mod_fcgid: handle concurrent requests, and these programs remain running to
mod_fcgid: handle further incoming requests. It is favored by the PHP
mod_fcgid: developers, for example, as a preferred alternative to running
mod_fcgid: mod_php in-process, delivering very similar performance.
