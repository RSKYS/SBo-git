Mosh is a remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports 
intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line 
editing of user keystrokes.

Mosh attempts to improve on SSH by being more robust and responsive, 
especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.

The mosh client must be run with a UTF-8 locale. Locales can be 
configured system wide in:

/etc/profile.d/lang.sh 
or 
/etc/profile.d/lang.csh

Alternatively set LANG to a UTF-8 locale (e.g. LANG=en_GB.UTF-8) 
somewhere else you consider suitable.

Additionally the server that you are connecting to must have the same 
locale installed (though it need not be set as the default).
