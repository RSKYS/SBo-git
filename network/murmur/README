Murmur is the VoIP server component for Mumble. Murmur is
installed in a system-wide fashion, but can also be run by
individual users. Each murmur process supports multiple virtual
servers, each with their own user base and channel list.
Administration of murmur is done through D-Bus.

This script requires the system to have a murmur user and group:

  # groupadd -g 261 murmur
  # useradd -g murmur -u 261 -d /var/lib/murmur -s /bin/false murmur

To use a different user and/or group:

  # MURMUR_USER=user MURMUR_GROUP=group ./murmur.SlackBuild

To run murmur at boot:

  # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur

  Add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.murmur start
  fi
