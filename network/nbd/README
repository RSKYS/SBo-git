Network Block Devices (NBD) is used to access a remote block device on
a local machine over a TCP/IP network. Provided in this package are the
userland apps nbd-client and nbd-server.

The nbd-server is used to export a block device over a TCP/IP network
to a remote client. It defaults to /etc/nbd-server/config for settings.
See man page nbd-server.

The nbd-client is used to connect to the remote nbd-server block device
over a TCP/IP network. It requires the nbd kernel module provided by
Slackware which creates /dev/nbd0 through /dev/nbd15 for local use.
See man page nbd-client.
