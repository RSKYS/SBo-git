Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across
network connections, using the TCP or UDP protocol.

It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used
directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same
time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since
it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has
several interesting built-in capabilities.

This package contains the OpenBSD rewrite of netcat, with Debian and
other patches, including support for IPv6, proxies, and Unix sockets.
The installed binary is named "nc.openbsd" and the manpage is as well.

BTW, this package conflicts with the netcat in slackware as it creates a
symbolic link /usr/bin/nc (to let libvirt stuff work correctly), so
remove netcat (nc) from your system before building/installing this.
