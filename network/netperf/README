Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of
many different types of networking. It provides tests for both uni-
directional throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments
currently measureable by netperf include:

TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
DLPI
Unix Domain Sockets
SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6
