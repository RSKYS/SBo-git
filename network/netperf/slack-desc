# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

netperf:
netperf: Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of
netperf: many different types of networking. It provides tests for both uni-
netperf: directional throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments
netperf: currently measureable by netperf include:
netperf: - TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
netperf: - DLPI
netperf: - Unix Domain Sockets
netperf: - SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6
