makechroot

Make a chroot-able tree in which to run installpkg or explodepkg netqmail (i.e.
from an interactive instance of chroot).
Can also test installpkg --root to this tree.

Whatever you do, you can step through the script commands in a root window.
After explodepkg, you can step through the install scripts.

See ../README.SBo for mkchroot caveats. Approximate disk usage: 1.5MB local
$CHROOT, 131MB mounted $CHROOT.

Set CHROOT to dir to buid (will be removed & re-created) (default is /tmp/t5).
Set PKGDIR to directory containing SBo packages (default is /usr/packages).
Set STRIP_INITTAB_SV=no to leave the SV line added by daemontools (dflt yes).
Set INSTALL_DAEMONTOOLS=yes to install daemontools (default is no).
Set STRIP_QMAIL_USERS_GROUPS=no to retain qmail users and groups (dflt yes).
Set VERBOSE_ADDCHROOT=false to suppress install progress reporting (dflt true).
Set MKCHROOT_IGNORE_LN_ERRORS=yes to suppress error messages from mounted chroot

If you specified INSTALL_DAEMONTOOLS=yes, you can try running inst_check from an
interactive chroot instance (qmail installation checker).
inst_check will tell you to mount /proc - be sure to umount it afterwards.
*if* the main system is running svscanboot, *and* the main system is not running
an MTA, on re-running inst_check you should see

  Congratulations, your LWQ installation looks good!

Otherwise you should see a self-explanatory error message. If the main system is
not runninmg svscanboot, you can start it in the chroot environment.
Remember to umount /proc before exitting chroot.
