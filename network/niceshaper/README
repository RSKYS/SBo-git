NiceShaper is a program working in a Linux router environment. It uses
a proven HTB QOS algorithm. It provides dynamic traffic shaping which
is more effective than traditional, static shaping. By constantly
monitoring packets flowing through the router in response to changing
load dynamically adjusts the bandwidth of acting classes to a level
enabling the fullest possible usage of a internet access. At the same
time does not allow for the creation of congestion, ensuring complete
convenience of interactive services.

NiceShaper outside the protection of each class using reasonable
bandwidth, offers a quota on the amount of transferred datas
and ability to automatically change the selected parameters
on specified hours. Automated IMQ and packets marking for support
multiple ISPs and cooperation with "Source NAT" on private IP
addresses. Comfortable - even remotely accessible - live monitoring
(statistics). Automatic writing statistics to a specified file
in defined interval, for example in order to make them web accesible.
An important goal of the project is clear and intuitive configuration
to make learning curve as short as possible. Exact information about
errors in configuration and encountered problems.

NiceShaper takes care of download when upload stops up.
