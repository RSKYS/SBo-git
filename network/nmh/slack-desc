# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nmh: nmh (The New Message Handler)
nmh:
nmh: nmh (new MH) is a powerful electronic mail handling system. nmh
nmh: consists of a collection of fairly simple single-purpose programs
nmh: to send, receive, save, retrieve, and manipulate e-mail
nmh: messages. Since nmh is a suite rather than a single monolithic
nmh: program, you may freely intersperse nmh commands with other
nmh: commands at your shell prompt, or write custom scripts which use
nmh: these commands in flexible ways.
