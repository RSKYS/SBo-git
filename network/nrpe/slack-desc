# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nrpe: nrpe (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor)
nrpe:
nrpe: The NRPE addon is designed to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on
nrpe: remote Linux/Unix machines. The main reason for doing this is to allow
nrpe: Nagios to monitor "local" resources (like CPU load, memory usage,
nrpe: etc.) remote machines. Since these public resources are not usually
nrpe: exposed to external machines, an agent like NRPE must be installed on
nrpe: the remote Linux/Unix machines.
