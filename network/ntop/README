ntop is a network probe that shows network usage in a way similar to
what top does for processes. In interactive mode, it displays the
network status on the user's terminal. In Web mode, it acts as a Web
server, creating an HTML dump of the network status.

It sports a NetFlow/sFlow emitter/collector, an HTTP-based client
interface for creating ntop-centric monitoring applications, and
RRD for persistently storing traffic statistics.

ntop needs to run under its own user/group. This has been assigned to
the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change it on your
system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   ntop            UID: 212        GID: 212
  group:  ntop                            GID: 212
You can change pass alternate values for the user and group using
NTOPUSER and NTOPGROUP variables when running the build script.

Logs are placed in /var/log/ntop/ and will be rotated every week. The
log rotation will restart the ntop server which will reset the ntop
statistics. If you want to keep the statistics you have to edit or delete
the /etc/logrotate.d/ntop file.

For some important post-build and basic configuration instructions,
see the included 'README.SLACKWARE' file.
