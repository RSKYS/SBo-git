client.c:

Also included is the source for a client.  This client.c program is
designed to fake being a web browser. It sends the expected requests to
the web server over a network socket connection and displays the results
as text rather than graphically displaying the results. In the code you
will have to change the two lines as below to match your web server or
nweb server.  See README.client for instructions.  The client.c source
code can be found in the /usr/doc/nweb-<VERSION> directory.
