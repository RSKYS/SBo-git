Oinkmaster is a script that will help you update and manage your
Snort rules.  It is released under the BSD license and will work on
most platforms that can run Perl scripts, e.g. Linux, *BSD, Windows,
Mac OS X, Solaris, etc. Oinkmaster can be used to update and manage
the VRT licensed rules, the community rules, the bleeding-snort rules
and other third party rules, including your own local rules.
