The Open-iSCSI project is a high-performance, transport independent,
multi-platform implementation of RFC3720 iSCSI.

Open-iSCSI is partitioned into user and kernel parts.

The kernel portion of Open-iSCSI is a from-scratch code
licensed under GPL. The kernel part implements iSCSI data path
(that is, iSCSI Read and iSCSI Write), and consists of three
loadable modules: scsi_transport_iscsi.ko, libiscsi.ko and iscsi_tcp.ko.

User space contains the entire control plane: configuration
manager, iSCSI Discovery, Login and Logout processing,
connection-level error processing, Nop-In and Nop-Out handling,
and (in the future:) Text processing, iSNS, SLP, Radius, etc.

The user space Open-iSCSI consists of a daemon process called
iscsid, and a management utility iscsiadm.

NOTE:
open-isns is a build-time requirement, not a a run-time requirement.
