This is a partial implementation of iSNS, according to RFC4171.

The distribution comprises

isnsd
This is the iSNS server, supporting persistent storage
of registrations in a file based database.

isnsadm
A command line utility for querying the iSNS database,
and for registering/deregistering nodes and portals

isnsdd
An iSNS Discovery Daemon, which is still very much work
in progress. The daemon is supposed to handle all the
bit banging and server communications required to register
a node, its portals, and to maintain the registration.
It is also supposed to use the iSNS State Change Notification
framework to learn of new targets or initiators coming online,
and inform local services (such as the iSCSI initiator daemon)
about these changes.

NOTE
Due to a static library dependency this Slackbuild is required to
compile the Linux Open-iSCSI Initiator (open-iscsi). It is not required
to run the initiator, therefore it does not need to be installed unless
you intend to use any of the ISNS components on your network.
