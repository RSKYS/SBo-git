OpenL2TP is a complete implementation of RFC2661 - Layer Two Tunneling
Protocol Version 2, able to operate as both a server and a client.

OpenL2TP has been written specifically for Linux. It consists of
- a daemon, openl2tpd, handling the L2TP control protocol exchanges
  for all tunnels and sessions
- a plugin for pppd to allow its PPP connections to run over L2TP
  sessions
- a Linux kernel driver for efficient datapath (packaged separately).
- a command line application for management.

All data packets are handled by the Linux kernel in order that the
datapath be as efficient as possible. The Linux PPP-over-L2TP kernel
driver (pppol2tp.o) must be loaded either dynamically as a kernel
module or linked in statically.

See README.SLACKWARE for post-installation configuration notes.
