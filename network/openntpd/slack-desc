# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

openntpd: OpenNTPD is a FREE, easy to use implementation of the Network Time
openntpd: Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote
openntpd: NTP servers and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the
openntpd: local clock. OpenNTPD is part of the OpenBSD Project, and this is the
openntpd: portable version.
