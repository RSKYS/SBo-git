OpenSM provides an implementation for an InfiniBand Subnet Manager
and Administrator. Such a software entity is required to run
for in order to initialize the InfiniBand hardware (at least
one per each InfiniBand subnet).

Run the SlackBild script with the environment variable METIS set to
anything but "no" to enable metis support for nue routing:

    env METIS=yes ./opensm.SlackBuild

The optional dependency "metis" can be installed from either the
"metis" or the "suitesparse" package, both of which are available
on SlackBuilds.org.
