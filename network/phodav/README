Phodav is a WebDav server implementation using libsoup (RFC 4918).
It was initially developed as a filesharing mechanism for Spice, but
it is generic enough to be reused in other projects.
It provides chezdav, a tool that allows to share a particular
directory (with optional digest authentication).

avahi is an optional dependency.
