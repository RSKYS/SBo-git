PhpPgAdmin is a Web-based application written in PHP that can manage one
or more PostgreSQL databases. It is 100% compatible with PostgreSQL. It
performs all the standard Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data 
Manipulation Language (DML) statements. It can back up and restore an
entire cluster, and can manage a Slony replication cluster, all in an
easy-to-understand interface.

Of course a Postgresql server must be accessible, mod_php enabled and
package 'php-pgsql' installed.

Please adapt 'config.inc.php', 'phppgadmin.conf' for apache, ...
to your needs.
