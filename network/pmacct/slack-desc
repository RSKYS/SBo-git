# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pmacct: correlate control-plane data via BGP and BMP; collect infrastructure
pmacct: data via Streaming Telemetry.

pmacct: Each component works both as a standalone daemon and as a thread of
pmacct: execution for correlation purposes (ie. enrich NetFlow with BGP
pmacct: data).
