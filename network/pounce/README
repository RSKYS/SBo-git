pounce(1) is a multi-client, TLS-only IRC bouncer. It maintains a
persistent connection to an IRC server, acting as a proxy and buffer for
a number of clients.  When a client connects, any messages received
since it last disconnected will be relayed to it. Unlike some other
bouncers, pounce uses a single buffer for all IRC messages, which acts
as a queue from which each client reads messages independently.

pounce speaks regular modern IRC to both servers and clients, using the
server-time extension to indicate when messages originally occurred.
Clients identify themselves to pounce by their IRC usernames. See
QUIRKS(7) for notes on connecting pounce with particular networks and
clients.

Also included are pounce-notify(1) and pounce-palaver(1)

DEPENDENCIES

pounce requires either libtls or libressl.  libtls is the smaller,
faster build of the two.
