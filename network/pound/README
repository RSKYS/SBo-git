The Pound program is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-
end for Web server(s). Pound was developed to enable distributing the
the load among several Web-servers supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP
data objects, and to allow for a convenient SSL wrapper for those web
servers that do not offer it natively.  Pound is distributed under 
the GPL license.

Be sure to see the README.SLACKWARE file in this directory before
using pound (it's also installed into the standard documentation
directory by the build script).
