README.SLACKWARE

Adding something like this to your /etc/syslog.conf file, and then 
restarting syslogd should enable pound logging to its own files.

# Redirect pound logs 
local6.=info		                         -/var/log/pound/access.log 
local6.notice					 -/var/log/pound/error.log 

You might want to add "local6.none" to the excludes as well, but that's
your call.
