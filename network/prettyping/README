Prettyping is a wrapper around the standard ping tool with the
objective of making the output prettier, more colorful, more compact,
and easier to read.

Prettyping runs the standard ping in the background and parses its
output, showing the ping responses in a graphical way at the terminal
(by using colors and Unicode characters).
