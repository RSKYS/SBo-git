Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities
for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers,
controlling access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk.
Privoxy has a flexible configuration and can be customized to suit
individual needs and tastes.  It has application for both stand-alone
systems and multi-user networks.

Before executing the script, you will need to create 
a privoxy user and group.  To do that, run the following commands:

groupadd -g 206 privoxy
useradd -u 206 -g 206 -c "Web Proxy" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false privoxy

To run privoxy at boot, the following code needs to
be added to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy start
  fi

Then add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.privoxy stop
  fi
