Development branch of Psi XMPP client by psi-dev@conference.jabber.ru

NOTE This is intended for advanced users and developers.
NOTE This can coexist with the stable psi package.

In 2009 a Psi fork named Psi+ was started. Project purposes are:
implementation of new features, writing of patches and plugins for
transferring them to upstream. As of 2017 the most of active Psi+
developers have become official Psi developers, but Psi+ still has a
number of unique features. From developers point of view Psi+ is just a
development branch of Psi IM client which is hosted at separate git
repositories and for which rolling release development model is used.
