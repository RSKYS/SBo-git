Hangouts plugin for libpurple

A replacement prpl for Hangouts in Pidgin/libpurple to support the
proprietary protocol that Google uses for its Hangouts service.
So far it supports all the fun things that aren't part of the XMPP
interface, such as Group Chats, synchronised history between devices
and SMS support via Google Voice.
