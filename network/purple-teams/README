purple-teams (Microsoft Teams plugin for libpurple)

A replacement prpl for Microsoft Teams in Pidgin/libpurple. At the 
moment it's primarily focused at "Teams for Work/School", but let me 
know in an issue if you're interested in "Teams for Personal" Totally 
a work in progress, but it's sending and receiving messages, so good 
enough to ship!

At this time the plugin does not support audio or video calls.
