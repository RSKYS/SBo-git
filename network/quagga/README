Quagga is a routing software suite, providing implementations of OSPFv2,
OSPFv3, RIP v1 and v2, RIPng and BGP-4 for Unix platforms, particularly
FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and NetBSD. Quagga is a fork of GNU Zebra which
was developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro. The Quagga tree aims to build a more
involved community around Quagga than the current centralised model of
GNU Zebra.
