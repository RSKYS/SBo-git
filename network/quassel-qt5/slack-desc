# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

quassel-qt5: Quassel IRC with Qt5 support is a modern, cross-platform, distributed
quassel-qt5: IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and
quassel-qt5: detach from a central core - much like the popular combination of
quassel-qt5: screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical.
