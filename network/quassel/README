Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning
that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central
core - much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC
client such as WeeChat, but graphical.

This build creates three binaries - quassel, quasselclient, and
quasselcore.

Please see the README.SBo file for a fuller description.
