Qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal vim-like GUI.
It's based on Qt and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and
Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

This SlackBuild installs all needed dependencies in a virtual
environment subfolder. This comes with an up-to-date Qt/PyQt including a
pre-compiled QtWebEngine binary, but has a couple of caveats:
* It only works on 64-bit x86 systems.
* It comes with a QtWebEngine compiled without proprietary codec support
  (such as h.264).

Before version 1.10.0 this SlackBuild used tox to manage virtualenv,
hence the name of the SlackBuild.
