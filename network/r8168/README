r8168 (Linux device driver for Realtek Ethernet controllers)

This is the Linux device driver released for RealTek RTL8168B/8111B,
RTL8168C/8111C, RTL8168CP/8111CP, RTL8168D/8111D, RTL8168DP/8111DP, and
RTL8168E/8111E Gigabit Ethernet controllers with PCI-Express interface.

This will need to be rebuilt for every new kernel installed.

To build the module for a kernel that isn't currently running on the
system, pass that kernel's "uname -r" output such as:

  KERNEL="4.4.0" ./r8168.SlackBuild

In order to avoid conflicts, /etc/modprobe.d/r8169_blacklist.conf
disables the r8169 driver.
