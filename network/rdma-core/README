The "rdma-core" is the userspace components for the Linux Kernel's
drivers/infiniband subsystem. Specifically this contains the
userspace libraries for the following device nodes:

    /dev/infiniband/uverbsX (libibverbs)
    /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm (librdmacm)
    /dev/infiniband/umadX (libibumad)

Additional service daemons are provided for:

    srp_daemon (ib_srp.ko)
    iwpmd (for iwarp kernel providers)
    ibacm (for InfiniBand communication management assistant)

The package "pandoc" (available on SlackBuilds.org) is an optional
build-time dependency. Some man-pages will be missing if "pandoc" was
unavailable when building the package "rdma-core".
