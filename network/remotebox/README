RemoteBox is an open-source VirtualBox client which means you can
remotely administer (ie over the network) an installation of
VirtualBox on a server, including its guests and interact with them
as if they were running locally. VirtualBox is installed on the
server machine and RemoteBox runs on the client machine. RemoteBox
provides a complete Gtk 3 graphical interface with a look and feel
similar to that of VirtualBox's native GUI and supports the vast
majority of features.
