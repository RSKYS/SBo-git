Realtek RTL8821CE Driver maintained by TomÃ¡s Pinho for Arch Linux.
Still, can serve Slackers as well!

NOTE:

  Although the driver builds for kernel 4.4.x as found in -14.2,
  I only tested it in the field on kernel 5.4.x as found in -current.
  Also, upstream warns that the source is targeting kernels > 4.14.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in:

  KERNEL=4.4.14 ./rtl8821ce.SlackBuild

NOTE:

1. If you experience problems using this driver (e.g. a non-working
   WiFi or Bluetooth), visit project's homepage to learn about possible
   solutions.
2. If you want to use this driver on -14.2, but with the kernel from
   -current, you will need to compile the kernel yourself on -14.2.
   Otherwise, you will run into compilation errors while building
   the driver. I have no intent of fixing that, unless you provide me
   with a working patch. ;-)
