Seafile is a next-generation open source cloud storage system with
advanced support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be
synced separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen
password. This password is not stored on the server, so even the
server admin cannot view a file's contents.

Seafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, wiki, and
discussion to enable easy collaboration around documents within a
team.

Note:
This package conflicts with seafile-client. Install just one of
them at the same time. If you want seafile-gui for some reasons
with seafile-server, you don't need seafile-client.

This package does not update/upgrade Seafile internal stuff.
See /opt/haiwen/seafile-server/scripts/upgrade and refer to the
Seafile manual:

  http://manual.seafile.com/deploy/upgrade.html

Stop your instance before upgrading this package and don't use
the shell scripts from the documentation, but use `seafile` from
/usr/sbin to start/stop Seafile.

This package is build for personal use, not business/enterprise
cases. Configuring for FCGI, MySQL, Cluster etc. you're on your
own, but any suggestions are welcome.
