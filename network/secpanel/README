secpanel (SSH GUI for Unix)

SecPanel serves as a GUI for managing and running SSH and SCP 
connections.
It's written in tcl.

Note: SecPanel is not a new implementation of the SecureShell
protocol or the ssh software-suite.  SecPanel sits on top of SSH
software-suites and supports the SSH.com and the OpenSSH-version.
