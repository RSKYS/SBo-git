serialmail (pass mail over intermittent links)

NB: serialmail is only useful if you are running the qmail MTA.
Please check the entry for netqmail before installing serialmail.

serialmail is a collection of tools originally designed for passing
mail across serial (dialup) links. Nowadays you can use it over
any intermittently available links, e.g. wifi at a conference.
serialmail works with qmail: you use qmail to deliver messages to a
maildir, and then serialmail to deliver messages out of the maildir.

serialmail supports SMTP, including ESMTP PIPELINING, and QMTP.
