sks-keyserver (OpenPGP keyserver)

SKS is an OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization. That means that a
key submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key
servers, and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience
spotty connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.

This SlackBuild will also verify the PGP signature of the package if
the following conditions are met:

- You have GnuPG installed
- You have the appropriate public PGP key (0x41259773973A612A)
  in your trustedkeys.gpg keyring
- You have downloaded the sig file from
  https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/downloads/sks-${VERSION}.tgz.asc


Groupname and username

You must have the 'sks' group and user to run this script,
for example:

  groupadd -r sks -g 295
  useradd -u 295 -g 295 -c "SKS keyserver" -d /var/lib/sks -r -M \
    -e 1970-01-02 -s /sbin/nologin sks
