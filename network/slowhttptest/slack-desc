# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

slowhttptest: slowhttptest (stress testing tool/DoS simulator)
slowhttptest:
slowhttptest: slowhttptest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some
slowhttptest: Application Layer Denial of Service attacks. It implements most
slowhttptest: common low-bandwidth Application Layer DoS attacks, such as
slowhttptest: lowloris, Slow HTTP POST, Slow Read attack (based on TCP
slowhttptest: persist timer exploit) by draining concurrent connections pool,
slowhttptest: as well as the Apache Range Header attack, leading to resource
slowhttptest: exhaustion.
