Smuxi is an open-source, powerful, flexible, and user-friendly chat client
created by Mirco Bauer and developed by other contributors.
Inspired by the combination of screen and irssi,
Smuxi has a detachable server (or like a "normal" client)
that stays connected when you aren't, and can allow multiple Smuxi frontends
like the GNOME frontend, or STFL text-based frontend) to be connected and in sync.
This is similar to screen+irssi or IRC bouncers, but more elegant and powerful.
