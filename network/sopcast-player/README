SopCast Player is designed to be an easy to use Linux GUI front-end
for the p2p streaming technology developed by SopCast. SopCast Player
features an integrated video player, a channel guide, and bookmarks.
Once SopCast Player is installed it simply "just works" with no
required configuration.

NOTE: While sopcast-player is architecture-neutral, the required
sopcast is only available for 32-bit.
