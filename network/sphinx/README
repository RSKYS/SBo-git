Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version 2.

Generally, it's a standalone search engine, meant to provide fast, 
size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other 
applications. Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with 
SQL databases and scripting languages.

mysql_config should be on your path when building, or you will need 
to edit the build script configure command to point to the MySQL 
library and include directories.
