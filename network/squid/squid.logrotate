# We set logfile_rotate=0 in squid.conf, which disables filename rotation
# by squid itself (as we'll let logrotate handle the filename rotation), but
# squid still closes and then reopens the logfile.  The goal of this file is
# to rotate the logfile (rename it from squid.log to squid.log.1) without
# compressing it immediately, as squid will still be writing to the renamed
# log file.  Then the postrotate script will tell squid to close and then 
# reopen squid.log, effectively using the new logfile.  The old logfile
# (squid.log.1) will be compressed by logrotate's next invocation.
