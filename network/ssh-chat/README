ssh-chat (IRC-like chat server using ssh as a client)

ssh-chat is a custom SSH server written in Go. Instead of a shell, you
get a chat prompt.

Note that this is only the server. There is no dedicated client: users
just use ssh to connect to the server.

This SlackBuild just repackages the official release binary, and does
not attempt to compile anything.

There is no startup script; if you want to run ssh-chat as a daemon,
add something like this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /usr/sbin/ssh-chat ]; then
  cd /
  /usr/sbin/ssh-chat <options> </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &
fi

Replace <options> with whatever options you want (one of which should
be --log). If you'd rather run as a non-root user, prefix the command
with e.g. "su - nobody -s ", and make sure your --bind has a port
numbered higher than 1024.
