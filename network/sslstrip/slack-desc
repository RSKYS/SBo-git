# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sslstrip: It will transparently hijack HTTP traffic on a network, watch for
sslstrip: HTTPS links and redirects, then map those links into either
sslstrip: look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links.
