surf (minimalist web browser)

surf is a simple web browser based on WebKit/GTK+. It is able to display
websites and follow links. It supports the XEmbed protocol which makes
it possible to embed it in another application. Furthermore, one can
point surf to another URI by setting its XProperties.

This build has many options controlled by environment variables. See
options.txt for full details.
