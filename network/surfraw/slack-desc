# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

surfraw: slashdot and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen
surfraw: lands of html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in
surfraw: unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.
