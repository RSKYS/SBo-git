surl (URL shortener)

surl is a URL shortening command line application that supports
various sites. It supports stdin or filename input. It grabs the
URLs, converts them, and returns the same text that was used in the
input. It is known to work with a few services, such as tinyurl.com,
is.gd, and others.

surl hasn't been updated in a few years, so not all of the services
it supports are still functional due to changes in the services' APIs.
The known non-working services have been disabled in this SlackBuild.

Note: Another "surl" project exists, on github. It's a service, not a
client like this surl.
