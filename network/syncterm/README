syncterm (BBS-oriented terminal emulator)

syncterm is a terminal emulator that connects to a host via
dialup modem, raw TCP, telnet, ssh, or rsync. Its user interface is
similar to ProComm. It's intended for use with BBSes (bulletin board
systems), and includes support for nonstandard ASCII variants such as
Atari 8-bit (ATASCII), Commodore 8-bit (PETSCII), and "IBM ANSI" as
used by MS-DOS.

syncterm can also be used as a local terminal (e.g. like xterm),
by creating a dialing list entry with address "shell:", command
"/bin/bash -login" or similar.

Some of the documentation is found only on the website:
