Syncthing (two way file sync between devices)

Syncthing is a free, open-source peer-to-peer, two-way file
syncronisation application available for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS,
Android, Solaris, Darwin and BSD. It can sync files between devices
on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet.

Before you can build Syncthing, you have to create a syncthing
user and group (used when running syncthing as a system-wide daemon):

groupadd -g 307 syncthing
useradd -d /var/lib/syncthing -g syncthing -s /bin/bash -u 307 syncthing

This package includes a rc.syncthing startup script, suitable for
running Syncthing as a system daemon - such as on a server.

The default location for the Syncthing config *and* sync repository
if run using the enclosed rc.syncthing is under /var/lib/syncthing,
but Syncthing is normally configured through its own web interface.
See project page for further details.
