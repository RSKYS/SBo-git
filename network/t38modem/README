What is t38modem?

 * From your fax or voice application view point it's a fax/voice modem pool.
 * From IP network view point it's a H.323/SIP endpoint with T.38 fax support.
 * From your view point it's a gateway between an application and IP network.

After installation update the /etc/rc.d/rc.t38modem.conf file with your SIP
account details and add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local script:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.t38modem ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.t38modem start
  fi

Optionally, you can add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.t38modem ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.t38modem stop
  fi

If you are using this package with Asterisk there is a sample resetmodem script
that can be placed in the your /var/spool/hylafax/etc directory.
