T50 is a tool designed to perform stress testing on a variety of
infrastructure network devices, covering some regular protocols (ICMP,
IGMP, TCP and UDP), some infrastructure specific protocols (GRE, IPSec
and  RSVP) and some routing protocols (RIP, EIGRP and OSPF).

The main differentiator of T50 is that it is able to send all
protocols sequentially using one single SOCKET, and it is capable of
being used to modify network routes, letting IT Security Professionals
perform advanced tests.
