Tailscale is a zero config VPN for building secure networks.
Install on any device in minutes. Remote access from any
network or physical location.

The service has two parts: tailscaled (daemon) and tailscale.
Both must run. I use this from a terminal:

daemon --user root tailscaled $exec && tailscale up

The first time, a url will pop up to authenticate.

Once the daemon is running, there's no need to restart it
until your next session. You can simply run

tailscale up
tailscale down

to connect and disconnect.
