.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBtnfs\-client\fP [\fIhost\fP [\fIport\fP]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
TNFS is a simplified Internet file transfer protocol, designed for
simplicity and ease of implementation on small systems, such as 8\-bit
computers. It\(aqs simpler than NFS, SMB, or FTP. It\(aqs similar to TFTP,
but has features TFTP lacks.
.sp
\fBtnfs\-client\fP is a simple client for the TNFS protocol. It uses UDP
port 16384 by default (standard for TNFS).
.sp
\fBtnfs\-client\fP doesn\(aqt mount the TNFS share as a directory (see
\fBtnfs\-fuse\fP(1) for that). It has a textmode user interface similar
to \fBftp\fP(1).
.sp
If \fBhost\fP is omitted, the default host is \fIvexed4.alioth.net\fP\&. If
\fBport\fP is omitted, the default port is \fI16384\fP\&.
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
The client supports these commands:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBls\fP [\fI\-l\fP]
List contents of current directory. With \fI\-l\fP, show details.
.TP
.B \fBdir\fP [\fI\-l\fP]
Synonym for \fBls\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBcd\fP \fIpath\fP
Change working directory on server to \fIpath\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBpwd\fP
Print current working directory on server.
.TP
.B \fBget\fP \fIremote\-filename\fP [\fIlocal\-filename\fP]
Download a file.
.TP
.B \fBput\fP \fIlocal\-filename\fP [\fIremote\-filename\fP]
Upload a file.
.TP
.B \fBmkdir\fP \fIpath\fP
Create a directory.
.TP
.B \fBrmdir\fP \fIpath\fP
Delete a directory (which must be empty).
.TP
.B \fBquit\fP
Exit the client.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that there\(aqs no \fBrm\fP command, or any other way to delete
a file. There\(aqs also no \fBlcd\fP command; you can\(aqt change the local
working directory, so make sure you\(aqre in the right place before you
start the client.
