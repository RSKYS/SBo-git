The Tor Browser lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux
without needing to install any software.
It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web
browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained.

By default, this package will build en-US version.
If you want to build other language, eg. France, download the
appropriate source and run :
PRGLANG=fr ./tor-browser.SlackBuild

Tor Browser 9.x is based on Firefox 68.2-ESR Release
