transgui (front-end to remotely control transmission)

Transmission Remote GUI is a feature rich cross platform front-end to
remotely control a Transmission Bit-Torrent client daemon via its RPC
protocol. Transmission Remote GUI is faster and has more functionality
than the built-in Transmission web interface.
