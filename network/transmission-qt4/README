transmission-qt4 (bittorrent client)

Transmission is a lightweight open source BitTorrent client, providing
useful functionality without feature bloat. It consists of a daemon, a
GTK+, Qt and CLI client.

This is an older release of transmission, and only the Qt4 client is
provided. For the rest of the components (the GTK+ client, the daemon,
and the command-line client), install the main transmission package.
It's safe to install both transmission and transmission-qt4.
