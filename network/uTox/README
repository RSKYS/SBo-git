Lightweight Tox client that uses Xlib.
Supports many features and is on-par with other Tox clients.

To build with GTK2 support instead of the default GTK3, execute:
    GTK2=yes ./uTox.Slackbuild

Since version 0.13.1, uTox REQUIRES libraries from the c-toxcore
package. Please note c-toxcore's README which recommends removal
of any existing c-toxcore package prior to building.
