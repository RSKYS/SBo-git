Udpxy is a UDP-to-HTTP multicast traffic relay daemon: it forwards UDP 
traffic from a given multicast subscription to the requesting HTTP
client. Udpxy was written to build on POSIX-compliant systems, with
the minumum of external dependencies and configuration steps it was
also designed to maintain a small memory footprint and run on devices
with limited resources (CPU, RAM).
