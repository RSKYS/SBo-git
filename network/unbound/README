Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver.
The C implementation of Unbound is developed and maintained by 
NLnet Labs. It is based on ideas and algorithms taken from a java 
prototype developed by Verisign labs, Nominet, Kirei and ep.net.

Unbound is designed as a set of modular components, so that also DNSSEC 
(secure DNS) validation and stub-resolvers (that do not run as a server,
but are linked into an application) are easily possible.

A user and group are recommended to run Unbound. The following should
not conflict with anything else on SlackBuilds:

  groupadd -g 304 unbound
  useradd -r -u 304 -g unbound -d /etc/unbound/ -s /sbin/nologin -c \
  'Unbound DNS resolver' unbound

Note: As of version 1.16.2, the script was almost entirely rewritten.
The idea was not only to modernize the script, but also make the
application more compatible with the Slackware architecture and to
be as easy to "just install and run the app". Also to note: 
The control app titled unbound-countrol is enabled by 
default but can be disabled in unbound.conf. It's secure, binds
to localhost and can't be used by non-root users.
