unicornscan (flexible and efficient network probing)

Unicornscan is an attempt at a user-land distributed TCP/IP
stack. It is intended to provide a researcher a superior
interface for introducing a stimulus into and measuring a
response from a TCP/IP enabled device or network.

libdnet is an optional dependency: this will build an
internal version if not available.
