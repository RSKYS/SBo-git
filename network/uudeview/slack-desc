# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

uudeview:
uudeview: UUDeview is a program that helps you transmit and receive binary
uudeview: files over the Internet, using electronic mail or newsgroups The
uudeview: UUDeview package includes both an encoder and a decoder. The decoder
uudeview: automatically detects the type of encoding used, offering MIME's
uudeview: Base64 and BinHex as well as the popular uuencoding and the less
uudeview: frequently used xxencoding methods.  Recently, support for the
uudeview: popular yEnc encoding was also added. The encoder runs the other
uudeview: way around and encodes a binary file for sending it by mail or news.
