Vdirsyncer is a command-line tool for synchronizing calendars and
addressbooks between a variety of servers and the local filesystem.

It can also be used to synchronize calendars and/or addressbooks
between two servers directly.

It aims to be for calendars & contacts what OfflineIMAP is for emails.
