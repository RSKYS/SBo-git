Verm is a WORM (write-once, read-many) file store to make it easy to reliably
store and replicate files.

This script requires a 'verm' user/group to exist before running.

The recommended UID/GID is 346. You can create these like so:
    groupadd -g 346 verm
    useradd -u 346 -g 346 -m -d /var/lib/verm verm

The following can be used to start/stop verm automatically:
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.verm ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.verm start
    fi

/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.verm ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.verm stop
    fi

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not needed for runtime.
