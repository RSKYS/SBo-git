# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

vnstat: vnstat (a console-based network traffic monitor)
vnstat:
vnstat: vnStat is a network traffic monitor for Linux that keeps a log of
vnstat: daily network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnStat isn't a
vnstat: packetsniffer. The traffic information is analyzed from the /proc
vnstat: filesystem so vnStat can be used without root permissions. This
vnstat: program is open source (GPL) and can be installed in 'single' and
vnstat: 'root' mode.
