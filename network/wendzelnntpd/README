WendzelNNTPd is an IPv6-ready Usenet server (NNTP daemon) with the
main goal to maximize usability on the console level. WendzelNNTPd
achieves this by breaking down complicated things into an easy-to-use
configuration file and tool. The server is portable (Linux/*BSD/
*nix), supports AUTHINFO authentication, contains support for Access
Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and supports
invisible newsgroups. It currently supports MySQL and SQLite backends.

Note: This package is compiled without MYSQL support and uses
      sqlite3 instead.
      If you want to use MySQL instead of sqlite3, remove the
      "MYSQL=NO" before ./configure in wendzelnntpd.Slackbuild.
