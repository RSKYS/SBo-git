# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

wendzelnntpd: wendzelnntpd (Easy-to-use NNTP Server)
wendzelnntpd:
wendzelnntpd: WendzelNNTPd is an IPv6-ready Usenet server (NNTP daemon) with the
wendzelnntpd: main goal to maximize usability on the console level. WendzelNNTPd
wendzelnntpd: achieves this by breaking down complicated things into an easy-to-use
wendzelnntpd: configuration file and tool. The server is portable (Linux/*BSD/
wendzelnntpd: *nix), supports AUTHINFO authentication, contains support for Access
wendzelnntpd: Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and supports
wendzelnntpd: invisible newsgroups. It currently supports MySQL and SQLite backends.
wendzelnntpd: Note: This package is compiled without MYSQL support and uses
wendzelnntpd:       sqlite3 instead.
