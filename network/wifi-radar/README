WiFi Radar is a Python/PyGTK2 utility for managing WiFi profiles on
GNU/Linux.

It enables you to scan for available networks and create profiles for
your preferred networks. You can drag and drop your preferred networks
to arrange the profile priority.

WiFi Radar is tested to work with an Intel iwlagn 6300 on Slackware but
should work just the same for any iwconfig interface.

NOTE: wifi-radar needs to run as root. You may need to issue:
  xhost +local:root
which you can put in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc etc.

I've installed the program into /opt/radar-wifi and created a
/usr/bin/wifi-radar script that sets $DISPLAY which defaults to :0.0
For other $DISPLAY's you can edit the script in the slackbuild
directory, or pass DISPLAY=:N.n to wifi-radar on the command line.
