Simple, secure, private -- always end-to-end

Our personal and professional data is at the center of a new economy.
The information we share on social networks, via email, and messaging
services is being used to build profiles. These profiles are in turn
used to sell us products and services through targeted advertising and
suggestion. The data collected is vast, detailed, and often very
personal.  Vast resources are being spent to refine the profiles, all
without transparency, policy or oversight.

Our personal and professional online communications should not be part
of this economy. In the physical world we talk with each other directly.
We can lower our voices or close a door to share private thoughts.
In the online world we should be able to communicate directly without
passing our private communications through these corporate data mines.

Wire is different.
