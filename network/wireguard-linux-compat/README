WireGuard is a VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography. It is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces
and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

This script only builds the WireGuard kernel module.  Userspace
tools are also required to configure and use WireGuard tunnels. Refer
to the wireguard-tools script in Slackware.

NOTE: the kernel in Slackware already contains the WireGuard module.
This package is needed only if running a custom-built kernel < 5.6.x
(wireguard has been included from that version onward).
