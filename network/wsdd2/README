wsdd2 (WSD/LLMNR Descovery/Name Service Daemon)

Provides samba share descovery for clients who don't support netbios
or are running ip6 (which netbios does not support).
Effectively this allows modern windows computers to find samba
shares, and allows you to avoid smb1/smb2 for which there are many
exploits in the wild. This is based on the NETGEAR implimentation.

NOTE: make sure you allow local ip6 connections in your samba config
otherwise there will be no shares found. if you use "hosts allow"
then add     fc00::/7 fe80::/64 ::1
to the list of your local ip4 addresses so that local ip6 pcs can
use your shares.

NOTE2: make sure ports 5357 (tcp) and 3702 (udp) are open if you
are using a firewall.

to get wsdd2 to run automatically on startup add the following lines
in /etc/rc.d/rc.local

#start wsdd2 daemon if samba is configured
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 start
fi

and to stop it on shutdown, add the following to
samba section in /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 stop
fi
