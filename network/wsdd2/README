wsdd2 (WSD/LLMNR Discovery/Name Service Daemon)

Provides samba share discovery for clients who don't support netbios
or are running ip6 (which netbios does not support).
This is based on the NETGEAR implimentation.

NOTE: make sure you allow local ip6 connections in your samba config
otherwise there will be no shares found. if you use "hosts allow"
in smb.conf then add     fc00::/7 fe80::/64 ::1
to the list of your local ip4 addresses so that local ip6 pcs can
use your shares.

NOTE2: The following ports/addresses also need to be open if you are
using a firewall:
tcp port 3702 (unicast), and
udp ports 3702 ( multicast on ports 239.255.255.250 / ff02::c )
tcp port 5355 (unicast), and
udp on ports 224.0.0.252 / ff02::1:3  (multicast)

to get wsdd2 to run automatically on startup add the following lines
in /etc/rc.d/rc.local

#start wsdd2 daemon if samba is configured
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 start
fi

and to stop it on shutdown, add the following to
samba section in /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown

#stop wsdd2 daemon
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.wsdd2 stop
fi
