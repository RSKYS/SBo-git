# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wsdd2: Provides samba share browsing for clients who don't support netbios
wsdd2: or are running ip6 (which netbios does not support).
wsdd2: Effectively this allows modern windows computers to find samba
wsdd2: shares, and allows you to avoid smb1/smb2 for which there are many
wsdd2: exploits in the wild. This is based on the NETGEAR implimentation.
wsdd2:
wsdd2: Don't forget to allow local ip6 connections in your smb.conf file.
