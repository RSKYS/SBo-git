X2Go enables you to access a graphical desktop of a computer over
a low bandwidth (or high bandwidth) connection.
X2Go is a Remote Desktop solution, which is not to be confused
with Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection.
You can connect from a computer running Linux, Windows or MacOS X.
Multiple users/clients can access a single X2Go Server at the same
time, with each user/client having an individual Desktop session
by default; however, desktop sharing is possible.
This is the client.
