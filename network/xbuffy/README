XBuffy is a multi folder biff program for X. It allows the user to
specify multiple mail folders to poll for new mails. Supported
formats are mbox, maildir and (experimentally) MH.

This script builds against Athena widgets by default. You can change
this by passing GUI=xaw3d or GUI=motif instead. Additionally, pass
NNTP=server.address to enable support for polling newsgroups.
