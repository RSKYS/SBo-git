# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xnetload: It either displays bytes/second or packets/second, based on the
xnetload: capabilities of the kernel. On 2.1.x and later kernels (including the
xnetload: 2.2.x and 2.4.x series) it displays bytes/s. It requires the /proc
xnetload: file system, or rather /proc/net/dev which is only found in Linux.
