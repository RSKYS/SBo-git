xtables-addons (additions for iptables/xtables)

Xtables-addons is a set of additional extensions for the Xtables packet
filter that is present in the Linux kernel (which is loosely known by
its administrative commands iptables/ip6tables/etc.).

Xtables-addons succeeds the older patch-o-matic and patch-o-matic-ng
packages. Likewise, it contains extensions that were not, or are not
yet, accepted in the main kernel/iptables packages.

This package builds some kernel modules, so it will need to be
rebuilt any time you change kernels.
