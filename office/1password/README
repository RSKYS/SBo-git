1password is used to keep important information safe

Note:
This SlackBuild does not build 1password from source,
it repackages the binary. 1password is constantly
updated without changing the download name. This
will lead to md5sum failures.

1password can be used offline, as mentioned in this
page from the 1password support community:
https://1password.community/discussion/106746/can-i-
use-1password-offline

It uses Mozilla Firefox as the default browser. Modify
other/custom_allowed_browsers if you want to use a
different browser based on the following:

browser-integration-works
