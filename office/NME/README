NME (Nyctergatis Markup Engine)

NME, or Nyctergatis Markup Engine, is an open-source ISO-C
implementation of a markup parser based on Creole 1.0.

Creole is a collaborative effort to create a common markup language
to be used across different wikis. It is a work in progress, and
currently it is difficult to assess its potential success.
