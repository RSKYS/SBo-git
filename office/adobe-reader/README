Adobe's Acrobat Reader application (official binary) repackaged
in "Slackware style" for easier system maintenance.

This only works on the x86 architecture (no x86_64, arm, ...), although
it may work on x86_64 systems with alienBOB's multilib installed.

Note: The package will have the 3-letter language code in
the version number. The default language is "enu" (for US
English). E.g. for VERSION=9.5.5, the package will be called
adobe-reader-9.5.5_enu-i486-1_SBo.tgz by default. To use a different
language, first download the .tgz file for that language from Adobe's
site, then set ADOBE_LANG="xxx" in the environment, where "xxx" is the
3-letter language code and run the SlackBuild.
