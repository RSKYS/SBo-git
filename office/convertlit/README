convertlit (converts .lit files to Open E-Book format .epub format)

Converts Microsoft Reader format eBooks into open format for use with
software or devices which are not directly compatible with Microsoft's
Reader.

Note that convertlit's output is a directory with the epub contents. The
output is HTML, and can be viewed with any browser. To actually make
an .epub file, the output dir needs to be zipped. This build includes a
wrapper script called lit2epub that does the conversion and zipping in
one go.
