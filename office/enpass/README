Enpass is a multiplatform password manager keeping your passwords across
Linux, Winows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and browsers.

If browser fails to open Enpass after synchronization service has been
authenticated - run this command (as regular user) and try again:

# xdg-mime default enpass.desktop x-scheme-handler/enpassauth

If Enpass is picking the wrong scale factor for your display, add the
following lines to your ~/.profile

export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0
export QT_SCREEN_FACTORS=1
(adjust as per your display)

In case of multiple displays:

export "QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS=1;1"

Logout/login current desktop session and start Enpass.
