epy (terminal ebook reader)

epy is an ebook viewer that runs in a terminal and displays most
ebook formats, including epub, fb2, mobi, azw, and azw3. Since it's a
textmode application, it doesn't display images.

After installation, run "epy --help" for usage information. Also,
press the ? key while epy is running, to see the built-in help.
