This is the last GTK2 version of evince. It will conflict with the 
latest one, so don't install both.

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to 
replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop 
with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the following file formats:
* PDF
* Postscript
* DjVu
* TIFF
* CBR/CBZ (comic books)
* DVI (requires optional dependency texlive)
* XPS (requires optional dependency libgxps)
