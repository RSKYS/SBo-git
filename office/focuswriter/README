FocusWriter is a fullscreen, distraction-free word processor designed
to immerse you as much as possible in your work. 
The program autosaves your progress, and reloads the last files you
had open to make it easy to jump back in during your next writing
session, and has many other features that make it such that only one
thing matters: your writing.

A focuswriter-legacy SlackBuild, which does not depend on qt5,
is available.
