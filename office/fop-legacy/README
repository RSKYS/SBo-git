Apache FOP is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects. It
is a Java application that reads a formatting object tree conforming
to the XSL 1.1 Recommendation (05 December 2006) and then turns it
into a PDF document, certain other output formats or allows you to
preview it directly on screen. 

Output formats currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP, XML
(area tree representation), Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser extent,
RTF and TXT.  The primary output target is PDF.

The goals of the Apache FOP project are to deliver an XSL-FO to PDF
formatter that is compliant to at least the Basic conformance level
described in the W3C Recommendation from 05 December 2006, and that
complies with the November 2001 Portable Document Format Specification
(Version 1.4) from Adobe Systems.

This is the old fop 2.3 for the incredibly ancient jdk 6 (including
openjdk6).  If you are running jdk 7 or newer, you will need fop, also
available on SBo.

Also note that fop and fop-legacy cannot coexist on the same computer.

jai and jai-imageio are optional but recommended dependencies.
