full-pack is a set of dictionaries for kbg/gbgoffice.  It includes a 
bidirectional English-Bulgarian dictionary, a dictionary of computer 
terms, a polytechnical dictionary and a dictionary of the Bulgarian 
North-West dialect.  

The dictionary engine is provided by either kbgoffice or gbgoffice,
so this package depends either from one or the other.
