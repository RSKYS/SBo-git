The GTK BG Office assistant (Gbgoffice) is part of the Bulgarian
Office project (Bgoffice). Gbgoffice provides an easy to use GTK+
interface for the Bgoffice dictionaries. It supports all five of them:

1) Dual Bulgarian English dictionary
2) Dictionary of computer terms
3) Dialect dictionary ;)
4) Polytechnical English Bulgarian dictionary
5) Thesaurus

After gbgoffice is installed, you need full-pack for the dictionaries.

NOTE: If you use KDE, you may want kbgoffice (QT4 interface) instead.
