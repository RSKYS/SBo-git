gmdb2 is the official GUI for mdbtools.
It lets you open, inspect, and export Microsoft Access databases 
(.mdb and .accdb files) on Mac and Unix machines.
This is considered beta-quality software.
Originally written by Brian Bruns in the early 2000s, the software
was recently ported to GTK+3 and has been tested on Mac, Linux, and
FreeBSD.
