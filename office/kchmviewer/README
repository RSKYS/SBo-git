KchmViewer is a chm (MS HTML help file format) viewer written in
C++.  Unlike most existing CHM viewers for Unix, it uses the 
Trolltech Qt widget library and does not depend on KDE or Gnome. 
However, it may be  compiled with full KDE support including KDE 
widgets and KIO/KHTML.

The main advantage of KchmViewer is extra support for non-English 
languages.  Unlike other viewers, KchmViewer in most cases is able 
to detect help file encoding, correctly shows tables of contents of 
Russian, Korean, Chinese and Japanese help files, and does correct 
search in non-English help files (search for MBCS languages - 
ja/ko/ch is still in progress).

KchmViewer is written by George Yunaev (see the contacts page
for details), and is licensed under the GNU GPL license. It uses 
chmlib and some ideas and code from xhcm.
