Khard is an address book for the Unix console. It creates, reads,
modifies and removes vCard address book entries at your local machine.
Khard is also compatible to the email clients mutt and alot and the
SIP client twinkle.

Warning: If you want to create or modify contacts with khard, beware
that the vcard standard is very inconsistent and lacks interoperability
Different actors in that sector have defined their own extensions and
even produce non-standard output. A good example is the type value,
which is tied to phone numbers, email and post addresses. Khard tries to
avoid such incompatibilities but if you sync your contacts with an
Android or iOS device, expect problems. You are on the safe side, if you
only use khard to read contacts.
