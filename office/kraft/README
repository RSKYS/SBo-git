Kraft is a free software project that helps to create office documents
especially for small enterprise operators such as handcrafters.
It is a Qt/KF5 based desktop software with a strong focus on ease of use
and a 'just enough' feature set for the use case.

These features are provided:
- Customer management, deeply integrated in the KDE using KAddressbook
- Automatted creation of offers, invoices and similar documents
- Text templates
- Calculation
- Material management
- Configurable document creation in PDF format

The project also provides an Appimage but at least on Slackware 15.0
the KAddressbook integration via akonadi does not work.
The currency format used by the software is inherited from the regional
settings of your desktop environment.

To compute PDF watermarks kraft uses "PyPDF2" (optional dependency)
