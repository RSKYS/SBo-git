Krop is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files. It is
written in Python and relies on PyQt, python-poppler-qt4, and PyPDF for
its functionality. It features automatic margin cropping.

Krop can automatically split pages into subpages to fit the limited
screen size of devices such as eReaders. This is particularly useful, if
your eReader does not support convenient scrolling.
