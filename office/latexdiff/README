latexdiff is a Perl script which compares LaTeX files and marks
significant differences between them. It can be used with several
version control systems (RCS, CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, and Git).

The package also contains latexrevise, a tool for selective removal
of markup and text from latexdiff output.
