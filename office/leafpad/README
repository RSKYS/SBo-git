Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity. As
development focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most
essential features are implemented in the editor. Leafpad is simple to
use, is easily compiled, requires few libraries, and starts up quickly.

libgnomeprint & libgnomeprintui are optional dependencies.
