Official description (beware marketing buzzwords)
================================================
Ledger Live is our platform of apps and services integrated specifically
to work with your Nano device. It functions as a secure gateway to the
crypto ecosystem. This means accessing a variety of crypto, NFT and DeFi
based services directly and seamlessly from your hardware wallet â€“ a
better, simpler user experience that bypasses a major security concern
known as blind signing.
