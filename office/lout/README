Lout - a document formatting system

Lout is a document formatting system designed and implemented by
Jeffrey Kingston at the Basser Department of Computer Science,
University of Sydney, Australia. 

The system reads a high-level description of a document similar in
style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript file which can be printed
on most laser printers and graphic display devices. A plain text
output option is available, as is a highly experimental PDF output
mode (users are encouraged to generate PostScript, then convert to
PDF using GhostScript instead.) 

Lout is inherently multilingual. Adding new languages is easy. The
following languages are currently supported (in alphabetical order):
Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian,
Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish,
Swedish.

The Lout language, in which most document typesetting and layout
tasks are implemented, is a purely functional language, which
simplifies reasoning about the operations performed.
