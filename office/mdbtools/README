The MDB Tools project is a effort to document the MDB and ACCDB file
formats used in Microsoft's Access database packages, and to provide
a set of tools and applications to make that data available on other
platforms.

NOTE: unixOBDC is an optional dependency.
By default the script will build a driver for use with unixODBC,
if it is installed. If a driver for iodbc is preferred instead
you may set the environment variable UNIXODBC_DRIVER to "no". e.g.
   UNIXODBC_DRIVER="no" ./mdbtools.SlackBuild

This script includes the debugging tools 'prcat', 'prkkd', 'prtable',
'prdata' and 'prole', preffixed with "mdb-" (e.g. 'mdb-prtable')
unless the environment varaible DEBUGGING_TOOLS is set to "no". e.g.
  DEBUGGING_TOOLS="no" ./mdbtools.SlackBuild
