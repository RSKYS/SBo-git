mupdf is a lightweight PDF, CBZ, and XPS viewer and toolkit.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
graphics. MuPDF renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to
within fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing
the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7
with transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching
and more. It also reads XPS and OpenXPS documents. MuPDF is written
modularly, so features can be added on by integrators if they so
desire.

Optional dependency: tesseract. If this is installed, mupdf will be
built with OCR support. If it's installed but you don't want to build
mupdf with it, export TESSERACT=no in the environment.

Notes:

1. It's no longer possible to build mupdf without JavaScript support.

2. Three mupdf executables are installed in /usr/bin. mupdf-x11 is the
regular PDF viewer, and mupdf-x11-curl has support for fetching remote
resources from the network (which may be considered a security risk).
mupdf-gl uses OpenGL for rendering (and doesn't support curl).
