Muttprint formats the output of mail clients to a good-looking
printing. It uses the typesetting system LaTeX, which is normally part
of every Linux distribution and which is also available for other
operating systems like *BSD and Solaris.

Muttprint is programmed in Perl and works in German, Italian, Spanish,
French, Swedish, Slovenian, Polish and English. But it can be
configured to work in any other language.

Muttprint supports the charsets ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-3,
ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-9, Windows-1250, Windows-1252 and recently UTF-8.
