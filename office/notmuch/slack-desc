# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

notmuch: notmuch (fast mail indexer for maildir)
notmuch:
notmuch: Notmuch is an answer to Sup. Sup is a very good email program written
notmuch: by William Morgan (and others) and is the direct inspiration for
notmuch: Notmuch. Notmuch began as an effort to rewrite performance-critical
notmuch: pieces of Sup in C rather than ruby. From there, it grew into
notmuch: a separate project. One significant contribution Notmuch makes
notmuch: compared to Sup is the separation of the indexer/searcher from
notmuch: the user interface. (Notmuch provides a library interface so that
notmuch: its indexing/searching/tagging features can be integrated into any
notmuch: email program.)
