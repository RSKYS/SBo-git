paps (Unicode-aware text to PostScript/PDF/SVG converter)

paps reads a UTF-8 encoded file and generates a PostScript language
(or PDF, or SVG) rendering of it, on standard output. The rendering is
done by creating outline curves through the pango ft2 backend.

Optional runtime dependency: source-highlight. This is only used by
the src-to-paps command, and can be installed after the fact, without
rebuilding paps.
