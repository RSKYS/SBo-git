Plover (rhymes with "lover") is a desktop application that allows
anyone to use stenography to write on their computer, up to speeds of
200WPM and beyond.

Plover is part of the Open Steno Project. The Open Steno Project's
goal is to provide everything you need to learn machine shorthand
on your own, from free software, to cheap hardware, to learning
resources.

Plover is GPLv2+ as of version 3.1.0. See the license for details.
