Semantik is a Mind Mapping software for KDE.

Mind Maps are edited either as Flat trees
or in two dimensions.Each node on the map can
be associated with tables,text,pictures or diagrams.

Maps are then converted to "flat" documents such
as presentations or reports using document generators.
This enables the rapid creation of technical
documentation in the LaTeX, OpenOffice or Html format.
