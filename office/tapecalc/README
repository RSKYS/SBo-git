tapecalc (calculator with curses 'register tape' UI)

tapecalc (aka "add") is a full-screen tape editor that lets the user
edit a calculation. It is a curses application.

It's more suitable for balancing a checkbook than a spreadsheet or any
of the various hand-calculator clones.

Note: the colors of the user interface (white on blue) can't be
configured. However, tapecalc can be tricked into running in
monochrome, with a command like:

  $ TERM=vt100 tapecalc
