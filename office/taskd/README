Taskwarrior is an open-source cross platform command-line 
task management tool. It allows you to capture, annotate, 
manipulate and present your tasks, then sync them among 
devices. 

The taskd server is the component which supports 
synchronization among task clients.

The task client application is also available on SBo.

Each may be built and run standalone so that there are
no hard buildtime or runtine dependencies between them.

It is recommended to create a non-priv'd user to run the
server, and it requires CA certs to operate, which may
be generated with included scripts.

Installation of this package provides a complete taskd
install from upstream source. You may proceed to configure
and operate it from the distribution documentation if you
like.

The additional README_SLACKWARE file provides notes for
getting things configured and working quickly on a Slackware
platform with a few extra pieces provided.
