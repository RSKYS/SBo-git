GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was both inspired
by TeX and GNU Emacs.  The software aims to provide a unified and
user friendly framework for editing structured documents with
different types of content (text, graphics, mathematics, interactive
content, etc.).  The rendering engine uses high-quality typesetting
algorithms so as to produce professionally looking documents, which
can either be printed out or presented from a laptop.
