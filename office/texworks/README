TeXworks is an environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc)
documents, with a Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF
viewer, and a clean, simple interface accessible to casual and
non-technical users. The integrated PDF viewer supports synctex, e.g.
control-clicking within the source text to locate the corresponding
position in the PDF, and vice versa.

Optionally, hunspell dictionaries provide spellchecking support.
Install hunspell-de, hunspell-en, hunspell-es or hunspell-pl.
