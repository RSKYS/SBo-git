The ultimate replacement for spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners,
PIMs, text editors and small databases.

Suitable for any kind of data organization, such as Todo lists,
calendars, project management, brainstorming, organizing ideas,
planning, requirements gathering, presentation of information, etc.

It's like a spreadsheet, immediately familiar, but much more
suitable for complex data because it's hierarchical.
It's like a mind mapper, but more organized and compact.
It's like an outliner, but in more than one dimension.
It's like a text editor, but with structure.

Note: Multilib is required in order to run TreeSheets on x86_64.

Note 2: The download is not versioned, so the version may be higher
than the one of this SlackBuild (and in this case, the MD5SUM won't
match).
