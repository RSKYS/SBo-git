uncsv (convert to or from CSV streams)

uncsv is a filter command converting the lines of a CSV file into
non-escaped, non-quoted delimited file (pipe by default). This program
will error out if it encounters a character matching the delimiter, it
will also replace the carriage return and new-line characters found in
quoted values allowing you to use awk to play with your CSVs.

csv is the opposite of this command. It takes an unquoted stream of
values, separated by the delimiter of your choice (default: pipe '|')
and produces a "standard" CSV file.
