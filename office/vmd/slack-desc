# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

vmd: Render markdown in a terminal! Why? Because although Markdown is
vmd: still readable as-is, if you use Markdown a lot, it's nice to have
vmd: something to render it with the proper formatting - with bold text
vmd: and emphasis, etc.
