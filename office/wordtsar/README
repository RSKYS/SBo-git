wordtsar (wordstar clone)

WordTsar is a clone of WordStar 7.0D, with a look and feel very
similar to the original, including the standard set of keystrokes.
It loads Wordstar 4, Wordstar 7, RTF (partial), and DOCX (partial)
files, and saves in Wordstar 7 and RTF format.

Note that WordTsar is alpha-quality software.

If you're looking for a clone of the old MS-DOS textmode WordStar,
Slackware already ships "jstar" (part of the "joe" package).

Command-line users, the executable is called WordTsar, not wordtsar.
