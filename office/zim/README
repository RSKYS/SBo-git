Zim aims to bring the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is
saved as a text file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other
pages, and are saved automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as
linking to a non-existing page. This tool is intended to keep track of
TODO lists or to serve as a personal scratch book. But it will also
serve you when writing longer and more complicated documents.

A "desktop wiki" means that we try to capture the idea of a wiki, not
as a webpage but as a collection of files on your local file system
that can be edited with a GUI application. The main focus is a kind
of personal wiki that serves for all kind of notes: todo-lists,
addresses, brainstorm ideas etc.

But we want to go further then just a wiki filled with random content.
It should also be possible to use you random notes as the basis for
more structured data: articles, presentations etc. Zim will not include
tools to layout a presentation or something like that, you should use
your office suite of choice for that, but it should be a tool that can
deliver all the content for a presentation in a form that only needs a
template and some layout before usage. Therefore certain features
normally not found in wikis will be added.

NOTE: Zim can be expanded with plugins.  From 'preferences' go to
'plugins' and anything marked 'failed' can be installed either
from SBo or pip.  These aren't dependencies; Zim runs without them.
