# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zim: Zim aims to bring the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page
zim: is saved as a text file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to
zim: other pages, and are saved automatically. Creating a new page is as
zim: easy as linking to a non-existing page. This tool is intended to keep
zim: track of TODO lists or to serve as a personal scratch book. But it
zim: will also serve you when writing longer and more complicated
zim: documents.
