This module implements a simple, stateless and non-blocking HTTP
client. It supports GET, POST and other request methods, cookies and
more, all on a very low level. It can follow redirects, supports
proxies, and automatically limits the number of connections to the
values specified in the RFC.

It should generally be a "good client" that is enough for most HTTP
tasks. Simple tasks should be simple, but complex tasks should still
be possible as the user retains control over HTTP message headers.
