# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: perl-AnyEvent-HTTP (simple but non-blocking HTTP/HTTPS client)
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP:
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: This module implements a simple, stateless and non-blocking HTTP
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: client. It supports GET, POST and other request methods, cookies and
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: more, all on a very low level. It can follow redirects, supports
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: proxies, and automatically limits the number of connections to the
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: values specified in the RFC.
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP:
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: It should generally be a "good client" that is enough for most HTTP
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: tasks. Simple tasks should be simple, but complex tasks should still
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP: be possible as the user retains control over HTTP message headers.
