perl-CGI-Application

CGI::Application makes it easier to create sophisticated,
high-performance, reusable web-based applications. CGI::Application
helps makes your web applications easier to design, write, and evolve.

CGI::Application judiciously avoids employing technologies and
techniques which would bind a developer to any one set of tools,
operating system or web server.

It is lightweight in terms of memory usage, making it suitable for
common CGI environments, and a high performance choice in persistent
environments like FastCGI or mod_perl.
