perl-CPAN-Perl-Releases (Mapping Perl releases to their locations)

CPAN::Perl::Releases is a module that contains the mappings of all
perl releases that have been uploaded to CPAN to the authors/id/ path
that the tarballs reside in.

This is static data, but newer versions of this module will be made
available as new releases of perl are uploaded to CPAN.
