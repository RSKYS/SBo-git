# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Class-Data-Inheritable: perl-Class-Data-Inheritable (Inheritable, overridable class data)
perl-Class-Data-Inheritable:
perl-Class-Data-Inheritable: Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class
perl-Class-Data-Inheritable: data. That is, if you want to store something about your class as a
perl-Class-Data-Inheritable: whole (instead of about a single object). This data is then inherited
perl-Class-Data-Inheritable: by your subclasses and can be overriden.
