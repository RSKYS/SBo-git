# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Coro: perl-Coro (the only real threads in perl)
perl-Coro:
perl-Coro: Coro provides a full shared address space, which makes communication
perl-Coro: between threads very easy. And coro threads are fast, too: disabling
perl-Coro: the Windows process emulation code in your perl and using Coro can
perl-Coro: easily result in a two to four times speed increase for your
perl-Coro: programs. A parallel matrix multiplication benchmark (very
perl-Coro: communication-intensive) runs over 300 times faster on a single core
perl-Coro: than perls pseudo-threads on a quad core using all four cores.
