# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Cpanel-JSON-XS: modules, none of them correctly handle all corner cases, and in most
perl-Cpanel-JSON-XS: cases their maintainers are unresponsive, gone missing, or not
perl-Cpanel-JSON-XS: listening to bug reports for other reasons.
