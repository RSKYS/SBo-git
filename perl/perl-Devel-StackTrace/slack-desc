# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Devel-StackTrace:
perl-Devel-StackTrace: The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace
perl-Devel-StackTrace: and Devel::StackTrace::Frame. The goal of this object is to
perl-Devel-StackTrace: encapsulate the information that can found through using the caller()
perl-Devel-StackTrace: function, as well as providing a simple interface to this data.
