# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-EV: This module is very fast and scalable. It is actually so fast that
perl-EV: you can use it through the AnyEvent module, stay portable to other
perl-EV: event loops and still be faster than with any other event loop
perl-EV: currently supported in Perl.
