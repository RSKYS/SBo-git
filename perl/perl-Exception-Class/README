perl-Exception-Class (allows you to declare real exception classes)
Exception::Class allows you to declare exception hierarchies in your
modules in a "Java-esque" manner. It features a simple interface
allowing programmers to 'declare' exception classes at compile time.
It also has a base exception class, Exception::Class::Base, that can
be easily extended.
