File::HomeDir is a module for locating the directories that are
"owned" by a user (typicaly your user) and to solve the various
issues that arise trying to find them consistently across a wide
variety of platforms.

The end result is a single API that can find your resources on any
platform, making it relatively trivial to create Perl software that
works elegantly and correctly no matter where you run it.
