perl-File-Inplace

File::Inplace is a perl module intended to ease the common task of
editing a file in-place. Inspired by variations of perl's -i option,
this module is intended for somewhat more structured and reusable
editing than command line perl typically allows. File::Inplace
endeavors to guarantee file integrity; that is, either all of the
changes made will be saved to the file, or none will. It also offers
functionality such as backup creation, automatic field splitting
per-line, automatic chomping/unchomping, and aborting edits partially
through without affecting the original file.
