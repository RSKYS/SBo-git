# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-File-pushd:
perl-File-pushd: File::pushd does a temporary chdir that is easily and automatically
perl-File-pushd: reverted, similar to pushd in some Unix command shells. It works by
perl-File-pushd: creating an object that caches the original working directory. When
perl-File-pushd: the object is destroyed, the destructor calls chdir to revert to the
perl-File-pushd: original working directory. By storing the object in a lexical
perl-File-pushd: variable with a limited scope, this happens automatically at the end
perl-File-pushd: of the scope.
