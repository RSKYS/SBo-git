perl-GD (perl bindings for GD image library)

GD.pm is a Perl interface to Thomas Boutell's gd graphics library.
GD allows you to create color drawings using a large number of
graphics primitives, and emit the drawings as PNG files.

The package includes the bdf2gdfont.pl utility, which converts X11 BDF
fonts to the format used by GD.

perl-GD can optionally be built with support for FastCGI. To do
this, first install libraries/fcgi, then run perl-GD.SlackBuild with
FASTCGI=yes set in the environment.
