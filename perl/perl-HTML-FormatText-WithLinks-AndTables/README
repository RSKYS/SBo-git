perl-HTML-FormatText-WithLinks-AndTables

This module was inspired by HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has
proven to be a useful `lynx -dump` work-alike. However one frustration
was that no other HTML converters I came across had the ability to deal
affectively with HTML <TABLE>s. This module can in a rudimentary sense
do so. The aim was to provide facility to take a simple HTML based
email template, and to also convert it to text with the <TABLE>
structure intact for inclusion as "multipart/alternative" content.
Further, it will preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD>
tag's "align" attribute, and will also preserve multiline text inside
of a <TD> element provided it is broken using <BR/> tags.
