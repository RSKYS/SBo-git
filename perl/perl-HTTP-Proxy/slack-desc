# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-HTTP-Proxy: perl-HTTP-Proxy (a pure Perl HTTP proxy)
perl-HTTP-Proxy:
perl-HTTP-Proxy: This module implements an HTTP proxy, using an HTTP::Daemon to accept
perl-HTTP-Proxy: client connections, and a LWP::UserAgent to ask for the requested
perl-HTTP-Proxy: pages. The most interesting feature of this proxy object is its
perl-HTTP-Proxy: ability to filter the HTTP requests and responses through user-
perl-HTTP-Proxy: defined filters.
