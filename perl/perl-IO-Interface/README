perl-IO-Interface (access to network card configuration information)

IO::Interface  adds  methods  to  IO::Socket  objects that allows them
to  be  used  to  retrieve  and  change  information about the network
interfaces on your  system.  In addition to the object-oriented access
methods, you can use a function-oriented style.
