perl-IO-Socket-Socks Provides a way to create socks client or server.

IO::Socket::Socks connects to a SOCKS proxy, and tells it to open a
connection to a remote host/port when the object is created. The object
you receive can be used directly as a socket (with IO::Socket
interface) for sending and receiving data from the remote host. In
addition to creating a socks client this module can also be used to
create socks server.
