# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-IO-Socket-Socks: perl-IO-Socket-Socks (Provides a way to create socks client/server)
perl-IO-Socket-Socks:
perl-IO-Socket-Socks: IO::Socket::Socks connects to a SOCKS proxy, and tells it to open a
perl-IO-Socket-Socks: connection to a remote host/port when the object is created. The
perl-IO-Socket-Socks: object you receive can be used directly as a socket (with IO::Socket
perl-IO-Socket-Socks: interface) for sending and receiving data from the remote host. In
perl-IO-Socket-Socks: addition to creating a socks client this module can also be used to
perl-IO-Socket-Socks: create socks server.
