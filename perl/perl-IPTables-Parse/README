IPTables-Parse (Perl extension for parsing iptables and
ip6tables policies)

The IPTables::Parse package provides an interface to parse iptables or
ip6tables rules on Linux systems through the direct execution of
iptables/ip6tables commands, or from parsing a file that contains an
iptables/ip6tables policy listing.
