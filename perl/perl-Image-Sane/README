Image::Sane - Perl extension for the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) 
Project

These Perl bindings for the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) Project
allow you to access SANE-compatible scanners in a Perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management
in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.
