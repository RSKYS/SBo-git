# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext: perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext (Joins gettext and Maketext frameworks)
perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext:
perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext: Locale::Maketext::Gettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext
perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext: frameworks. It is a subclass of Locale::Maketext(3) that follows the
perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext: way GNU gettext works. It works seamlessly, both in the sense of GNU
perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext: gettext and Maketext. As a result, you enjoy both their advantages,
perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext: and get rid of both their problems, too.
