# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD: perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD (Performing SVD and eigenvector decomp)
perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD:
perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD: The singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important factorization
perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD: of a rectangular real matrix. Eigendecomposition is the factorization
perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD: of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented
perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD: in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This module implements
perl-Math-GSL-Linalg-SVD: the SVD and Eigen decomposition routines of the The GSL.
