Modern::Perl - enable all of the features of Modern Perl with one import

Modern Perl programs use several modules to enable additional features
of Perl and of the CPAN. Instead of copying and pasting all of these
use lines, instead write only one:

        use Modern::Perl;

This enables the strict and warnings pragmas, as well as all of the
features available in Perl 5.10. It also enables C3 method resolution
order as documented in perldoc mro and loads IO::File and IO::Handle
so that you may call methods on filehandles. In the future, it may
include additional core modules and pragmas (but is unlikely to
include non-core features).
