perl-Module-Manifest (Parse and examine a distribution MANIFEST file)
Module::Manifest is a simple utility module created originally for use
in Module::Inspector. It can load a MANIFEST file that comes in a Perl
distribution tarball, examine the contents, and perform some simple
tasks. It can also load the MANIFEST.SKIP file and check that.
