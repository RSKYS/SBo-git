Mojolicious is a next generation web framework for Perl.

Back in the early days of the web, many people learned Perl because of
a wonderful Perl library called CGI. It was simple enough to get
started without knowing much about the language and powerful enough to
keep you going, learning by doing was much fun. While most of the
techniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is not.
Mojolicious is a new endeavor to implement this idea using bleeding
edge technologies.

Optional dependencies: perl-IO-Socket-Socks, perl-EV, perl-Role-Tiny, 
perl-Net-DNS-Native, perl-Cpanel-JSON-XS

The optional dependencies can be installed and uninstalled without
needing to rebuild perl-Mojolicious itself; they will be found at
runtime if they are installed.
