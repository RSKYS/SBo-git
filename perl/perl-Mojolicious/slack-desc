# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Mojolicious:
perl-Mojolicious: Back in the early days of the web, many people learned Perl because
perl-Mojolicious: of a wonderful Perl library called CGI. It was simple enough to get
perl-Mojolicious: started without knowing much about the language and powerful enough
perl-Mojolicious: to keep you going, learning by doing was much fun. While most of the
perl-Mojolicious: techniques used are outdated now, the idea behind it is not.
perl-Mojolicious: Mojolicious is a new endeavor to implement this idea using bleeding
perl-Mojolicious: edge technologies.
