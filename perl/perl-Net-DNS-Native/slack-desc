# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Net-DNS-Native: perl-Net-DNS-Native (non-blocking system DNS resolver)
perl-Net-DNS-Native:
perl-Net-DNS-Native: Net::DNS::Native provides several methods for host name resolution.
perl-Net-DNS-Native: It is designed to be used with event loops. All resolving is done by
perl-Net-DNS-Native: getaddrinfo(3) implemented in your system library. Since it is
perl-Net-DNS-Native: blocking function and we don't want to block, calls to this function
perl-Net-DNS-Native: will be done in separate thread. This class uses system native
perl-Net-DNS-Native: threads and not perl threads. So overhead shouldn't be too big.
