Pod::Parser is a base class for creating POD filters and translators.
It handles most of the effort involved with parsing the POD sections
from an input stream, leaving subclasses free to be concerned only
with performing the actual translation of text.

Note: this module is considered legacy and has been removed from the
standard perl distribution but is still needed for a bunch of things.
