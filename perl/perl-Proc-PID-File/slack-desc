# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Proc-PID-File: perl-Proc-PID-File (a module to manage process id files)
perl-Proc-PID-File:
perl-Proc-PID-File: The Proc::PID::File is useful for writers of daemons and other
perl-Proc-PID-File: processes that need to tell whether they are already running, in
perl-Proc-PID-File: order to prevent multiple process instances. The module accomplishes
perl-Proc-PID-File: this via *nix-style pidfiles, which are files that store a process
perl-Proc-PID-File: identifier.
