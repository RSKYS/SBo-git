This module is a first crack at providing a consistent interface to
Unix (and maybe other multitasking OS's) process table information.

This is mainly for other Perl programs, but there is also a command
line tool pswait which takes a list of process IDs or names and then
waits for one or all of them to end.  This is useful for scripts
dealing with process pools or concurrent pipelines.
