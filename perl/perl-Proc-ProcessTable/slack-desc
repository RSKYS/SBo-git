# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Proc-ProcessTable: Unix (and maybe other multitasking OS's) process table information.
perl-Proc-ProcessTable:
perl-Proc-ProcessTable: This is mainly for other Perl programs, but there is also a command
perl-Proc-ProcessTable: line tool pswait which takes a list of process IDs or names and then
perl-Proc-ProcessTable: waits for one or all of them to end.  This is useful for scripts
perl-Proc-ProcessTable: dealing with process pools or concurrent pipelines.
