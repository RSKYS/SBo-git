Scalar::Util contains a selection of subroutines that people have 
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would

would be so small that being individual extensions would be wasteful.

This SlackBuild provides a newer version of List::Utils, but does not
replace any of the files in Slackware's perl-5.22.2 package.
