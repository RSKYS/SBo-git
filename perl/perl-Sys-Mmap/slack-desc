# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Sys-Mmap: perl-Sys-Mmap (uses mmap to map in a file as a Perl variable)
perl-Sys-Mmap:
perl-Sys-Mmap: The mmap module uses the POSIX mmap call to map in a file as a Perl
perl-Sys-Mmap: variable. Memory access by mmap may be shared between threads or
perl-Sys-Mmap: forked processes, and may be a disc file that has been mapped into
perl-Sys-Mmap: memory.
