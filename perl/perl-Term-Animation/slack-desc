# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Term-Animation: perl-Term-Animation (ASCII sprite animation framework)
perl-Term-Animation:
perl-Term-Animation: This module provides a framework to produce sprite animations using
perl-Term-Animation: ASCII art. Each ASCII 'sprite' is given one or more frames, and
perl-Term-Animation: placed into the animation as an 'animation object'. An animation
perl-Term-Animation: object can have a callback routine that controls the position and
perl-Term-Animation: frame of the object.
