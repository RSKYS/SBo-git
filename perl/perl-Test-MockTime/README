perl-Test-MockTime module was created to enable test suites to test code
at specific points in time. Specifically it overrides localtime, gmtime,
and time at compile time. It then relies on the user supplying a mock
time via set relative_time, set absolute_time, or set_fixed_time to
alter future calls to gmtime, time, or localtime.
