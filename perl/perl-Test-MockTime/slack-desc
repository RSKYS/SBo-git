# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Test-MockTime:
perl-Test-MockTime: This module was created to enable test suites to test code at specific
perl-Test-MockTime: points in time. Specifically it overrides local_time, gmtime, and time
perl-Test-MockTime: at compile time. It then relies on the user supplying a mock time via
perl-Test-MockTime: set relative_time, set absolute_time, or set fixed_time to alter
perl-Test-MockTime: future calls to gmtime, time, or localtime.
