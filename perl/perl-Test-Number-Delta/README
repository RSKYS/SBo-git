Test::Number::Delta - Compare the difference between numbers 
against a given tolerance.

At some point or another, most programmers find they need to 
compare floating-point numbers for equality. The typical idiom 
is to test if the absolute value of the difference of the 
numbers is within a desired tolerance, usually called epsilon. 

This module provides such a function for use with Test::Harness. 
Usage is similar to other test functions described in Test::More.
