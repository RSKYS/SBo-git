# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Test-Script: perl-Test-Script (Basic cross-platform tests for scripts)
perl-Test-Script:
perl-Test-Script: The intent of Test-Script module is to provide a series of basic
perl-Test-Script: tests for 80% of the testing you will need to do for scripts in the
perl-Test-Script: script (or bin as is also commonly used) paths of your Perl
perl-Test-Script: distribution.  Further, it aims to provide this functionality with
perl-Test-Script: perfect platform-compatibility, and in a way that is as unobtrusive
perl-Test-Script: as possible.
