# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Test-Spec: perl-Test-Spec (Write tests in a declarative specification style)
perl-Test-Spec:
perl-Test-Spec: This is a declarative specification-style testing system for
perl-Test-Spec: behavior-driven development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a.
perl-Test-Spec: examples) are named with strings instead of subroutine names, so your
perl-Test-Spec: fingers will suffer less fatigue from underscore-itis, with the side
perl-Test-Spec: benefit that the test reports are more ligeble.
perl-Test-Spec:
perl-Test-Spec: This module is inspired by and borrows heavily from RSpec
perl-Test-Spec: (http://rspec.info/documentation/), a BDD tool for the Ruby
perl-Test-Spec: programming language.
