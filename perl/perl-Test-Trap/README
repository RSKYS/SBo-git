perl-Test-Trap (Trap exit codes, exceptions, output, etc.)
Primarily (but not exclusively) for use in test scripts: A block eval
on steroids, configurable and extensible, but by default trapping
(Perl) STDOUT, STDERR, warnings, exceptions, would-be exit codes, and
return values from boxed blocks of test code.
