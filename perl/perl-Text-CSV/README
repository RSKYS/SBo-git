Text::CSV provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
comma-separated values using Text::CSV_XS or its pure Perl version.

An instance of the Text::CSV class can combine fields into a CSV
string and parse a CSV string into fields. The module accepts either
strings or files as input and can utilize any user-specified
characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is perhaps
better called ASV (anything separated values) rather than just CSV.

This module is compatible with Text::CSV_XS 0.99 and later (except for
diag_verbose and allow_unquoted_escape).
