perl-Text-CharWidth (perl module)

This perl module, Text::CharWidth, gets number of occupied columns of
a string on a terminal.
This module supplies features similar as wcwidth(3) and wcswidth(3)
in C language.
It computes numbuer of columns occupied on the terminal by a text 
string, which is not always equal to its number of characters and
depends on the encoding used.

Parameters are to be given in locale encoding, not always in UTF-8.

This perl module is needed by Text::WrapI18N.
