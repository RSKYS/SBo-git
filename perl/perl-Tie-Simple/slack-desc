# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Tie-Simple:
perl-Tie-Simple: This module adds the ability to quickly create new types of tie
perl-Tie-Simple: objects without creating a complete class. It does so in such a way
perl-Tie-Simple: as to try and make the programmers life easier when it comes to
perl-Tie-Simple: single-use ties that I find myself wanting to use from time-to-time.
