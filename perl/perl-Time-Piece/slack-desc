# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Time-Piece: perl-Time-Piece (Perl Time::Piece module)
perl-Time-Piece:
perl-Time-Piece: This module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions
perl-Time-Piece: with implementations that return objects. It does so in a backwards
perl-Time-Piece: compatible manner, so that using localtime/gmtime in the way
perl-Time-Piece: documented in perlfunc will still return what you expect.
