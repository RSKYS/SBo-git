# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Types-Serialiser: perl-Types-Serialiser (simple data types for serialisation formats)
perl-Types-Serialiser:
perl-Types-Serialiser: This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common
perl-Types-Serialiser: serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a
perl-Types-Serialiser: shared repository of simple/small constants and containers that can
perl-Types-Serialiser: be shared by different implementations so they become interoperable
perl-Types-Serialiser: between each other.
