# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Variable-Magic: perl-Variable-Magic (Associate user-defined magic to variables)
perl-Variable-Magic:
perl-Variable-Magic: Magic is Perl's way of enhancing variables. This mechanism lets the
perl-Variable-Magic: user add extra data to any variable and hook syntactical operations
perl-Variable-Magic: (such as access, assignment or destruction) that can be applied to
perl-Variable-Magic: it. With this module, you can add your own magic to any variable
perl-Variable-Magic: without having to write a single line of XS.
