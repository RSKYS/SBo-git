# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-XML-TreeBuilder: perl-XML-TreeBuilder (perl library for tree of XML::Element objects)
perl-XML-TreeBuilder:
perl-XML-TreeBuilder: This module uses XML::Parser to make XML document trees constructed
perl-XML-TreeBuilder: of XML::Element objects (and XML::Element is a subclass of
perl-XML-TreeBuilder: HTML::Element adapted for XML). XML::TreeBuilder is meant
perl-XML-TreeBuilder: particularly for people who are used to the HTML::TreeBuilder /
perl-XML-TreeBuilder: HTML::Element interface to document trees, and who don't want to
perl-XML-TreeBuilder: learn some other document interface like XML::Twig or XML::DOM.
