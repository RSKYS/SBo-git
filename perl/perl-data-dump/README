perl-data-dump (Data::Dump - Pretty printing of data structures)

This module provide a few functions that traverse their argument and
produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl code that,
when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments.

The main feature of the module is that it strives to produce output that
is easy to read.

Note: This is not the same thing as Data::Dumper (which is already
included in Slackware's perl package).
