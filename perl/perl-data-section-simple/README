Data::Section::Simple is a simple module to extract data from "__DATA__"
section of a file.

As the name suggests, this module is a simpler version of the excellent
Data::Section. If you want more functionalities such as merging data
sections or changing header patterns, use Data::Section instead.

This module does not implement caching (yet) which means in every
"get_data_section" or "get_data_section($name)" this module seeks and
re-reads the data section. If you want to avoid doing so for the better
performance, you should implement caching in your own caller code.

If you don't like this design, again, use the superior Data::Section.
