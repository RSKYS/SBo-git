# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-event: perl-event (Event loop processing)
perl-event:
perl-event: The Event module provide a central facility to watch for various
perl-event: types of events and invoke a callback when these events occur. The
perl-event: idea is to delay the handling of events so that they may be
perl-event: dispatched in priority order when it is safe for callbacks to
perl-event: execute.
