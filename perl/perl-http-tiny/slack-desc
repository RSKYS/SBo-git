# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-http-tiny: perl-http-tiny (small, simple, correct HTTP/1.1 client)
perl-http-tiny:
perl-http-tiny: HTTP::Tiny is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed for doing simple
perl-http-tiny: requests without the overhead of a large framework like LWP::UserAgent
perl-http-tiny: It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports
perl-http-tiny: proxies and redirection. It also correctly resumes after EINTR.
perl-http-tiny: If IO::Socket::IP 0.25 or later is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use it
perl-http-tiny: instead of IO::Socket::INET for transparent support for both IPv4 and
perl-http-tiny: IPv6. Cookie support requires HTTP::CookieJar or an equivalent class.
