perl-local-lib (create and use a local lib/ for perl modules)

This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a
user-local Perl module library located within the user's home
directory. It also constructs and prints out for the user the list of
environment variables using the syntax appropriate for the user's
current shell, suitable for directly adding to one's shell
configuration file.
