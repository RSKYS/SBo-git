rename renames the filenames supplied according to the rule specified as
the first argument. The argument is a Perl expression which is expected
to modify the cat string for at least some of the filenames specified.
If a given filename is not modified by the expression, it will not be
renamed. If no filenames are given on the command line, filenames will
be read via standard input.
