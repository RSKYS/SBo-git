perl-tk (Tk graphical interface for Perl)

Perl/Tk is an extension for writing Perl programs with a GUI.

Tk was originally developed as an extension to the Tcl language for
use with the X Window System on Unix.  With its port to perl, Tk gives
Perl programmers the same control over the graphical desktop that Tcl
programmers have taken for granted.
