perlbrew (Manage perl installations in your $HOME)

perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of
perl in an easy way. It provides multiple isolated perl environments,
and a mechanism for you to switch between them.

Everything is installed under ~/perl5/perlbrew. You then need to
include a bashrc/cshrc provided by perlbrew to tweak the PATH for you.
