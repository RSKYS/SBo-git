Parsley uses the PEG algorithm, so each expression in the
grammar rules works like a Python expression.
In particular, alternatives are evaluated in order,
unlike table-driven parsers such as yacc, bison or PLY.

Parsley is an implementation of OMeta, an object-oriented
pattern-matching language developed by Alessandro Warth.
