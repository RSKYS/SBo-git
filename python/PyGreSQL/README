PyGreSQL is an open-source Python module that interfaces to a
PostgreSQL database. It embeds the PostgreSQL query library to allow
easy use of the powerful PostgreSQL features from a Python script.

For version 6.0, only Python versions 3.7 to 3.12 and
PostgreSQL versions 10 to 16 on the server are supported.
