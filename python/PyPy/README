PyPy is a very compliant implementation of the Python language.  PyPy
has several advantages and distinctive features: speed (Just-in-Time
compiler), lower memory usage for large programs, sandboxing and
stackless mode.

This script is for PyPy implementation of Python 2.7 from sources.
Beware: this takes up a lot of time and about 5Gb of RAM in a 64bit
system. And still 3Gb on a 32bit system.

Note: This package does conflict with pypy, overwriting files.

OPTIONAL: pypy or PyPy, available on SBo.
If pypy2 is installed, from binary repackaging using pypy, or from
a previous installation of PyPy, it'll be used instead of CPython2.7,
as it is twice as fast.
It might even be better for a first build of PyPy to build and install
pypy first.
pycparser is required only when using Slackware's CPython2.7
for building.

REQUIRES: you need one of pycparser, pypy or PyPy.
