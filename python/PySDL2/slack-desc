# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

PySDL2: PySDL2 (Python wrapper around the SDL2)
PySDL2:
PySDL2: PySDL2 is a wrapper around the SDL2 library and as such similar to
PySDL2: the discontinued PySDL project. In contrast to PySDL, it has no
PySDL2: licensing restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes
PySDL2: instead.
