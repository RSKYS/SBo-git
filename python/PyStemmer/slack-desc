# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

PyStemmer: PyStemmer (Snowball stemming algorithms, for information retrieval)
PyStemmer:
PyStemmer: PyStemmer provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a 
PyStemmer: "stemmed" form of a word. This is a form with most of the common 
PyStemmer: morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common 
PyStemmer: linguistic base form. This is most useful in building search engines
PyStemmer: and information retrieval software; for example, a search with 
PyStemmer: stemming enabled should be able to find a document containing 
PyStemmer: "cycling" given the query "cycles".
