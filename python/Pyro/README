Pyro stands for PYthon Remote Objects. It is an advanced and powerful
Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in Python, that is
designed to be very easy to use.

Pyro 3.x is in maintenance mode (only getting security- and bugfixes). 
New projects are strongly urged to use Pyro4 instead, 
which is the new Pyro version that is actively being developed.
