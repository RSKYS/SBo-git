Apprise allows you to send a notification to almost all of the most
popular notification services available to us today such as:
Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon SNS, Gotify, etc.

  * One notification library to rule them all.
  * A common and intuitive notification syntax.
  * Supports the handling of images and attachments
    (to the notification services that will accept them).
  * It's incredibly lightweight.
  * Amazing response times because all messages sent asynchronously.

NOTE: babel and pytest-runner are build requirements, but neither
are runtime deps.
