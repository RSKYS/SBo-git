# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

apsw: apsw (Another Python SQLite Wrapper)
apsw:
apsw: APSW is a Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database
apsw: engine. In contrast to other wrappers such as pysqlite it focuses on
apsw: being a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate the
apsw: complete SQLite API into Python. The documentation has a section on
apsw: the differences between APSW and pysqlite. APSW supports CPython 2.3
apsw: onwards and CPython 3.1 onwards.
