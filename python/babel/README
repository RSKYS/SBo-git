babel (python internationalization tools)

Babel is a collection of tools for internationalizing Python apps.
It's composed of two major parts:
- tools to build and work with gettext message catalogs;
- a Python interface to the CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository),
  providing access to various locale display names, localized number
  and date formatting, etc.
