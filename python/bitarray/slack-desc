# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bitarray: bitarray (Efficient arrays of booleans -- C extension)
bitarray:
bitarray: This module provides an object type which efficiently represents an
bitarray: array of booleans. Bitarrays are sequence types and behave very much
bitarray: like usual lists. Eight bits are represented by one byte in a
bitarray: contiguous block of memory.
