Cheetah3 is a free and open source template engine and code-
generation tool written in Python. Cheetah can be used unto itself,
or incorporated with other technologies and stacks regardless of
whether theyâ€™re written in Python or not.

At its core, Cheetah is a domain-specific language for markup 
generation and templating which allows for full integration with 
existing Python code but also offers extensions to traditional 
Python syntax to allow for easier text-generation.
