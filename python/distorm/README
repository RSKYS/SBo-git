distorm (Disassembler Library for x86/AMD64 binary streams)

diStorm is really a decomposer, which means it takes an 
instruction and returns a binary structure which describes 
it rather than static text, which is great for advanced 
binary code analysis.

diStorm is super lightweight (~45KB), ultra fast and easy 
to use (a single API)!
