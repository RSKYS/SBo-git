A Python-based, open source, platform independent, utility to
communicate with the ROM bootloader in Espressif ESP8266 & ESP32 chips.

esptool.py was started by Fredrik Ahlberg (@themadinventor) as an
unofficial community project. It is now also supported by Espressif.
Current primary maintainer is Angus Gratton (@projectgus).

esptool.py is Free Software under a GPLv2 license.

This (source) is downloaded from pypi.org/projects/esptool as the github
site does not have a complete sourcecode zip.
