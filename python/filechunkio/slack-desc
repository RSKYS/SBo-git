# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

filechunkio:
filechunkio: FileChunkIO is a way to upload huge files to Amazon S3 in multiple
filechunkio: parts without having to split them physically upfront (which requires
filechunkio: more time and twice the disk space) or creating in-memory chunks as
filechunkio: StringIO instances.
