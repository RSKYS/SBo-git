Summary

This is a command line python program to search keywords/key-phrases on
Google Images and optionally download images to your computer. You can
also invoke this script from another python file.

This is a small and ready-to-run program. No dependencies are required
to be installed if you would only want to download up to 100 images per
keyword. If you would want more than 100 images per keyword, then you
would need to install Selenium library along with chromedriver. Detailed
instructions in the troubleshooting section.

Compatibility

This program is compatible with both the versions of python - 2.x and
3.x (recommended). It is a download-and-run program with no changes to
the file. You will just have to specify parameters through the command
line.
