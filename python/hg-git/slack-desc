# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hg-git: and pull from a Git server repository from Mercurial.  This means you
hg-git: can collaborate on Git based projects from Mercurial, or use a Git
hg-git: server as a collaboration point for a team with developers using both
hg-git: Git and Mercurial.
