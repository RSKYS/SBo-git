html2text (turn HTML into equivalent Markdown-structured text)

html2text is a Python script that converts a page of HTML into clean,
easy-to-read plain ASCII text. Better yet, that ASCII also happens to
be valid Markdown (a text-to-HTML format).

html2text can be used as a standalone program ("html2text --help" for
usage) or as a Python library (import html2text).
