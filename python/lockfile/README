The lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple
API for locking files. 

Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockf and flock
functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is identical
across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms. 

This package is version 0.8 due to some API breakage in 0.9+

To build for Python 3:
    # PYTHON=python3 ./lockfile.SlackBuild
