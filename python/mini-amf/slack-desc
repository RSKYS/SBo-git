# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mini-amf: mini-amf (Action Message Format support for Python)
mini-amf:
mini-amf: Mini-AMF provides Action Message Format serialization and
mini-amf: deserialization support for Python, compatible with the Adobe Flash
mini-amf: Player.  It supports Python 2.7 and 3.4+.
mini-amf:
mini-amf: Mini-AMF is a trimmed-down version of PyAMF.  It provides only the
mini-amf: core serialization and deserialization primitives, and support for
mini-amf: reading and writing LSO objects on disk.  Support for Flex-specific
mini-amf: types, "remoting", and integration with web frameworks has all been
mini-amf: removed.  (Adapter classes are still supported.)
