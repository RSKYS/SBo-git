Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python. You can add type
hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check
them statically. Find bugs in your programs without even running them!

You can mix dynamic and static typing in your programs. You can always
fall back to dynamic typing when static typing is not convenient, such
as for legacy code.

github site does not have a complete sourcecode zip.
