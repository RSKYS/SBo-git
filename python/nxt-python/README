nxt-python (python module to control Lego NXT)

nxt-python is a python 2.x driver/interface for the Lego Mindstorms
NXT robot. Development for this has stalled, so there is no
[complete] Python3 implementation.

Setup
------

In order to use nxt-python with an NXT kit, you should add a 'lego'
group to your system, and add yourself to that group:

    # groupadd lego
    # usermod -a -G lego YourUserName

You will also want to set up a udev rule to identify NXT hardware and
grant the 'lego' group permission to use it.

A sample rule is included for you in /usr/share/nxt-python, but you may
want to verify the vendor code of the NXT unit.

To verify the vendor code, connect the NXT hardware to your computer
and then run:

    # lsusb

Look at the ID for the Lego device; it will probably be 0694, but if not,
then change the value in the sample udev rule to match.

Save the sample udev rule (70-lego.rules) to /etc/udev/rules.d/

Log out and log back in, and you should now have full control, via Python,
over your NXT hardware.
