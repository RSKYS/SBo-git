# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pathlib2: The old pathlib module on bitbucket is in bugfix-only mode. The goal
pathlib2: of pathlib2 is to provide a backport of standard pathlib module which
pathlib2: tracks the standard library module, so all the newest features of the
pathlib2: standard pathlib can be used also on older Python versions.
