pipdeptree is a command line utility for displaying the python
packages installed in an environment in form of a dependency
tree. Since 'pip freeze' shows all dependencies as a flat list,
finding out which are the top level packages and which packages do
they depend on requires some effort. This utility tries to solve this
problem.
