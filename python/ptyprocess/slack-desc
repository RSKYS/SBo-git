# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ptyprocess:
ptyprocess: Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with
ptyprocess: both the process and its pty.
ptyprocess: Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be
ptyprocess: a password prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes
ptyprocess: when it's going to a pipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style
ptyprocess: interfaces that rely on a terminal.
