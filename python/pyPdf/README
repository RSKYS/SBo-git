A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of:

    extracting document information (title, author, ...),
    splitting documents page by page,
    merging documents page by page,
    cropping pages,
    merging multiple pages into a single page,
    encrypting and decrypting PDF files.

It should run on any Python platform without any dependencies on
external libraries. It can also work entirely on StringIO objects
rather than file streams, allowing for PDF manipulation in memory. It
is therefore a useful tool for websites that manage or manipulate PDFs.

NOTE: the upstream project is NOT MAINTAINED. PyPDF2 is a fork based on
this project that provides enhanced features.
