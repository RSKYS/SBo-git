PyCHM is a package that provides bindings for Jed Wing's CHMLIB
library. The chm package contains four modules, namely chm.chm,
chm.chmlib, chm.extra and chm._chmlib. chm.chmlib is a low level
wrapper module around the API provided by the C library chmlib.
The build script will build Python3 modules automatically if you
have Python3 installed.
