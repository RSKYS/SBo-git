Pygtkspell contains bindings allowing to run Python
programs using the GtkSpell library, that extends GTK+'s
GtkTextView widget with support for spell-checking.

You can enable optional features by passing variables
to the script (VAR=yes/no ./pygtkspell.SlackBuild): see
the SlackBuild for details.

gnome-python is an optional dependency.
