pyqode.qt is a shim that let you write libraries/applications that
supports both PyQt and PySide.

We provide support for PyQt5, PyQt4 and PySide using the PyQt5 layout
(where the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets).

Basically, you write your code as if you were using PyQt5 but import
qt from pyqode.qt instead of PyQt5.
