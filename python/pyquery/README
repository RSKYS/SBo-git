pyquery (a jquery-like library for python)

pyquery allows you to make jquery queries on xml documents. The API is
as much as possible the similar to jquery. pyquery uses lxml for fast
xml and html manipulation.

It can be used for many purposes, one idea that I might try in the
future is to use it for templating with pure http templates that you
modify using pyquery. I can also be used for web scrapping or for
theming applications.

Optional python dependencies: webob, restkit, request, and deliverance
