python-gflags (Google's Python argument parsing library)

This project is the python equivalent of gflags, a commandline
flag implementation for C++ originally written by Google. It is
intended to be used in situations where a project wants to mimic the
command-line flag handling of a C++ app that uses gflags, or for a
Python app that, via swig or some other means, is linked with a C++
app that uses gflags.
