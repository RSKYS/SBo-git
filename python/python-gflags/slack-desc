# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-gflags:
python-gflags: This project is the python equivalent of gflags, a commandline
python-gflags: flag implementation for C++ originally written by Google. It is
python-gflags: intended to be used in situations where a project wants to mimic the
python-gflags: command-line flag handling of a C++ app that uses gflags, or for a
python-gflags: Python app that, via swig or some other means, is linked with a C++
python-gflags: app that uses gflags.
