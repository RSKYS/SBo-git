Python-GSSAPI is a Python binding to the Generic Security Service
Application Program Interface (GSSAPI). The GSSAPI provides a uniform
interface to security services which applications can use without
having to worry about implementation details of the underlying
mechanisms. The most commonly used mechanism is Kerberos v5, and this
package provides an easy way to use Kerberos authentication and
security from Python code.
