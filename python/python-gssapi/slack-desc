# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-gssapi: python-gssapi (Python Bindings for GSSAPI)
python-gssapi:
python-gssapi: Python-GSSAPI is a Python binding to the Generic Security Service
python-gssapi: Application Program Interface (GSSAPI). The GSSAPI provides a uniform
python-gssapi: interface to security services which applications can use without
python-gssapi: having to worry about implementation details of the underlying
python-gssapi: mechanisms. The most commonly used mechanism is Kerberos v5, and this
python-gssapi: package provides an easy way to use Kerberos authentication and
python-gssapi: security from Python code.
