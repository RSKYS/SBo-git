The bigfloat module is a Python wrapper for the MPFR library for
arbitrary precision floating-point reliable arithmetic.

The MPFR library is a well-known portable C library for
arbitrary-precision arithmetic on floating-point numbers. It provides
precise control over precisions and rounding modes and gives
correctly-rounded reproducible platform-independent results.

The bigfloat module aims to provide a convenient and friendly Python
interface to the operations and functions provided by the MPFR library.
The main class, BigFloat, gives an immutable multiple-precision
floating-point type that can be freely mixed with Python integers and
floats. The Context class, when used in conjunction with Pythons with
statement, gives a simple way of controlling precisions and rounding
modes. Additional module-level functions provide various standard
mathematical operations. There is full support for IEEE 754 signed
zeros, nans, infinities and subnormals.
