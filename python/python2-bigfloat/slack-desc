# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python2-bigfloat: python2-bigfloat (Arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic)
python2-bigfloat:
python2-bigfloat: The bigfloat module is a Python wrapper for the MPFR library for
python2-bigfloat: arbitrary precision floating-point reliable arithmetic.
python2-bigfloat:
python2-bigfloat: The MPFR library is a well-known portable C library for
python2-bigfloat: arbitrary-precision arithmetic on floating-point numbers. It provides
python2-bigfloat: precise control over precisions and rounding modes and gives
python2-bigfloat: correctly-rounded reproducible platform-independent results.
