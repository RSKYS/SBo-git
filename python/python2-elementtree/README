The Element type is a simple but flexible container object, designed
to store hierarchical data structures, such as simplified XML
infosets, in memory. The element type can be described as a cross
between a Python list and a Python dictionary.

The ElementTree wrapper type adds code to load XML files as trees of
Element objects, and save them back again.
