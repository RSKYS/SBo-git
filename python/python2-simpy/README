SimPy
=====

SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language based on
standard Python and released under the GNU LGPL.

It provides the modeller with components of a simulation model. These
include processes for active components like customers, messages and
vehicles as well as  resources for passive components that form limited
capacity congestion points (like servers, checkout counters and
tunnels). It also provides monitor variables to aid in gathering
statistics. SimPy comes with extensive plotting capabilities.

The distribution contains in-depth documentation, tutorials, and a large
number of simulation models.

To build documentation, pass DOCS=yes to the slackbuild. Requires the
optional dependency Sphinx.
