A traceback serialization library that allows you to pickle tracebacks
and raise exceptions with pickled tracebacks in different processes.
This allows better error handling when running code over multiple
processes (imagine multiprocessing, billiard, futures, celery etc).  It
also parses traceback strings and raise with the parsed tracebacks.
