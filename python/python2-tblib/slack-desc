# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python2-tblib: python2-tblib (Traceback serialization library)
python2-tblib:
python2-tblib: A traceback serialization library that allows you to pickle tracebacks
python2-tblib: and raise exceptions with pickled tracebacks in different processes.
python2-tblib: This allows better error handling when running code over multiple
python2-tblib: processes (imagine multiprocessing, billiard, futures, celery etc).
python2-tblib: It also parses traceback strings and raise with the parsed tracebacks.
