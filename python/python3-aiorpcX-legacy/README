aiorpcX is a generic asyncio library implementation of RPC suitable
for an application that is a client, server or both.

NOTE:
This is an older version of the program, kept here for compatibility
with Electrum.

IMPORTANT:
This package conflicts with python3-aiorpcX, python3-aiorpcX-legacy
and python3-aiorpcX cannot both be installed at the same time.
