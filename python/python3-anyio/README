AnyIO is an asynchronous networking and concurrency library that works
on top of either asyncio or trio. It implements trio-like structured
concurrency (SC) on top of asyncio, and works in harmony with the
native SC of trio itself.

NOTE: This will not compile if python3-setuptools-git-versioning is
installed. Please remove it to allow building of the package. It can be
reinstalled once you building/installing of python3-anyio is complete.
