python3-attrs (Classes Without Boilerplate)

attrs is the Python package that will bring back the joy of writing
classes by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object
protocols (aka dunder methods).

Its main goal is to help you to write concise and correct software
without slowing down your code.
