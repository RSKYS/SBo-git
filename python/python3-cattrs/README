python3-cattrs (Composable complex class sup. for attrs & dataclasses)

cattrs is an open source Python library for structuring and
unstructuring data. cattrs works best with attrs classes, dataclasses
and the usual Python collections, but other kinds of classes are
supported by manually registering converters.
