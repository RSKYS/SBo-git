python3-dasbus (python3 DBus library based on glib)

Dasbus is a DBus library written in Python 3, based on GLib and
inspired by pydbus. The code used to be part of the Anaconda
Installer project. It was based on the pydbus library, but we
replaced it with our own solution because its upstream development
stalled. The dasbus library is a result of this effort.
