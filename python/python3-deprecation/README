deprecation is a library that enables automated deprecations. It
offers the deprecated() decorator to wrap functions, providing proper
warnings both in documentation and via Python's warnings system,
as well as the deprecation.fail_if_not_removed() decorator for test
methods to ensure that deprecated code is eventually removed.
