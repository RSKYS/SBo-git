# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-dill: python3-dill ( serializing and de-serializing python objects)
python3-dill:
python3-dill: dill extends python's pickle module for serializing and
python3-dill: and de-serializing python objects to the majority of the
python3-dill: built-in python types. Serialization is the process of converting
python3-dill: an object to a byte stream, and the inverse of which is converting
python3-dill: a byte stream back to a python object hierarchy.
