The Falcon Web Framework

Falcon is a minimalist ASGI/WSGI framework for building
mission-critical REST APIs and microservices, with a focus on
reliability, correctness, and performance at scale.

When it comes to building HTTP APIs, other frameworks weigh you down
with tons of dependencies and unnecessary abstractions.
Falcon cuts to the chase with a clean design that embraces HTTP and
the REST architectural style.

Falcon apps work with any WSGI or ASGI server, and run like a champ
under CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+ (3.6+ required for ASGI).
