Fontmake compiles fonts from various sources such as
UFO, glyph and designspace into binaries such as
OTF and TTF. You can use it to create static instances
and variable fonts.

To generate OpenType fonts run

fontmake -u MyFontFamily/Regular.ufo

To generate Truetype fonts run

fontmake -u MyFontFamily/Regular.ufo -o ttf

To save the generated font in a different
directory run

fontmake -u MyFontFamily.ufo -o ttf --output-dir $DIR/ttf
