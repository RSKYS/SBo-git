# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-fypp: python3-fypp (Python powered Fortran metaprogramming)
python3-fypp:
python3-fypp:   Fypp is a Python powered preprocessor. It can be used for any 
python3-fypp: programming languages but its primary aim is to offer a Fortran 
python3-fypp: preprocessor, which helps to extend Fortran with condititional 
python3-fypp: compiling and template metaprogramming capabilities. Instead of 
python3-fypp: introducing its own expression syntax, it uses Python expressions 
python3-fypp: in its preprocessor directives, offering the consistency and 
python3-fypp: versatility of Python when formulating metaprogramming tasks. 
python3-fypp:   It puts strong emphasis on robustness and on neat integration 
python3-fypp: into developing toolchains.
