gmpy2 is an optimized, c-coded python extension module that supports
fast multiple-precision arithmetic. gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy
module. In addition to supporting gmp or mpir for multiple-precision
integer and rational arithmetic, gmpy2 adds support for the mpfr
(correctly rounded real floating-point arithmetic) and mpc (correctly
rounded complex floating-point arithmetic) libraries.

This is the python3 version of gmpy2.
