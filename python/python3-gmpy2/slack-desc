# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-gmpy2: python3-gmpy2 (multi-precision arithmetic for python 3)
python3-gmpy2:
python3-gmpy2: gmpy2 is an optimized, c-coded python extension module that supports
python3-gmpy2: fast multiple-precision arithmetic. gmpy2 is based on the original
python3-gmpy2: gmpy module. In addition to supporting gmp or mpir for
python3-gmpy2: multiple-precision integer and rational arithmetic, gmpy2 adds support
python3-gmpy2: for the mpfr (correctly rounded real floating-point arithmetic) and
python3-gmpy2: mpc (correctly rounded complex floating-point arithmetic) libraries.
