Python wrapper for the GnuTLS library

This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around
libgnutls, as well as low level bindings to the GnuTLS types and
functions via ctypes. The high level wrapper hides the details of
accessing the GnuTLS library via ctypes behind a set of classes that
encapsulate GnuTLS sessions, certificates and credentials and expose
them to python applications using a simple API.

The package also includes a Twisted interface that has seamless
intergration with Twisted, providing connectTLS and listenTLS methods
on the Twisted reactor once imported (the methods are automatically
attached to the reactor by simply importing the GnuTLS Twisted
interface module).
