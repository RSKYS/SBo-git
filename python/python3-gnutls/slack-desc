# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-gnutls: python3-gnutls (Python wrapper for the GnuTLS library)
python3-gnutls:
python3-gnutls: This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around
python3-gnutls: libgnutls, as well as low level bindings to the GnuTLS types and
python3-gnutls: functions via ctypes. The high level wrapper hides the details of
python3-gnutls: accessing the GnuTLS library via ctypes behind a set of classes that
python3-gnutls: encapsulate GnuTLS sessions, certificates and credentials and expose
python3-gnutls: them to python applications using a simple API.
