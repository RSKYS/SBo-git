# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-h11:
python3-h11: It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code
python3-h11: whatsoever. This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network
python3-h11: API, and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded,
python3-h11: asynchronous, or your own implementation of RFC 6214 - h11 won't judge
python3-h11: you.
