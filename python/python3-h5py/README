The h5py package is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format.

It lets you store huge amounts of numerical data, and easily manipulate
that data from NumPy. For example, you can slice into multi-terabyte
datasets stored on disk as if they were real NumPy arrays. Thousands
of datasets can be stored in a single file, categorized and tagged
however you want.
