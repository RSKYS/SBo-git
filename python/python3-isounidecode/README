This is a package for conversion and transliteration of unicode into
ascii or iso-8859-1 strings.
This is mostly a port of Perl Text::Unidecode to Python with additional
support for iso8859-1.
It works with different agree of success for different lanugages.
It works quite good for European languages, works ok for Russian, and
works to some extent for Arabic, Hindi.
