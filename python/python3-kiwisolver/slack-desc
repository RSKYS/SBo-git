# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-kiwisolver: python3-kiwisolver (an implementation of the Cassowary algorithm)
python3-kiwisolver:
python3-kiwisolver: This is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint
python3-kiwisolver: solving algorithm. Kiwi(solver) is an implementation of the algorithm
python3-kiwisolver: based on the seminal Cassowary paper. It is not a refactoring of the
python3-kiwisolver: original C++ solver. Kiwi(solver) has been designed from the ground
python3-kiwisolver: up to be lightweight and fast.
