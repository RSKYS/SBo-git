language-data is a supplement to the langcodes module for
working with standardized codes for human languages. It stores
the more bulky and hard-to-index data about languages, particularly
what they are named in various languages.

For example, this stores the data that tell you that 
the code "en" means "English" in English, or that 
"franc√©s" is the Spanish (es) name for French (fr).

The functions and test cases for working with this data are 
in langcodes, because working with the data correctly requires 
parsing language codes.

The data included in this package is:

*  The names of various languages, in various languages
*  The estimated population that speaks each language
*  The estimated population that writes each language

These are all extracted from the Unicode CLDR data package,version 40 
plus a few additional language names that fill in gaps in CLDR.
