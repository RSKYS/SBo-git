Mailman (the GNU Mailing List Manager)

Version 3 of the GNU mailing list manager.
This script builds, but may lack a few steps to be used out of the
box.
It is - for now - there as a basis for working on it.

However this installs everything needed to run mailman3 on a
Slackware.

For old mailman 2, see the mailman SlackBuild.
