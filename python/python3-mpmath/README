mpmath is a free (BSD licensed) Python library for real and complex
floating-point arithmetic with arbitrary precision. It has been
developed by Fredrik Johansson since 2007, with help from many
contributors.

This is the python3 version of mpmath and it can coexist with SBo's
mpmath package.

python3-gmpy2 is an optional runtime dependency.
