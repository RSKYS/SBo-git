ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python
framework for processing seismological data. It provides parsers
for common file formats, clients to access data centers and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation
of seismological time series. The goal of the ObsPy project is to
facilitate rapid application development for seismology.
