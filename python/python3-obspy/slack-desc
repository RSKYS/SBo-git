# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-obspy: python3-obspy (A Python Framework for Seismology)
python3-obspy:
python3-obspy: ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python
python3-obspy: framework for processing seismological data. It provides parsers
python3-obspy: for common file formats, clients to access data centers and
python3-obspy: seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation
python3-obspy: of seismological time series. The goal of the ObsPy project is to
python3-obspy: facilitate rapid application development for seismology.
