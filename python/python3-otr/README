This package implements Off-The-Record Messaging protocol in python.

Off-The-Record Messaging (OTR) is a cryptographic protocol that
provides encryption for instant messaging conversations. OTR uses a
combination of AES symmetric-key algorithm with 128 bits key length,
the Diffie-Hellman key exchange with 1536 bits group size, and the
SHA-1/SHA-256 hash functions.

Its primary purpose is to be a dependency for the Blink SIP client.
