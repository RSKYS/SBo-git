# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pathspec: pathspec is a utility library for pattern matching of file paths. So
python3-pathspec: far this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern matching which itself
python3-pathspec: is derived from Rsync's wildmatch. Git uses wildmatch for its
python3-pathspec: gitignore files.
