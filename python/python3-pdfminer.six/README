Pdfminer.six is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. It
focuses on getting and analyzing text data. Pdfminer.six extracts the
text from a page directly from the sourcecode of the PDF. It can also be
used to get the exact location, font or color of the text.

It is built in a modular way such that each component of pdfminer.six
can be replaced easily. You can implement your own interpreter or
rendering device that uses the power of pdfminer.six for other purposes
than text analysis.

Pdfminer.six comes with two handy tools: pdf2txt.py and dumppdf.py.

The pdf2txt.py tool extracts all the text from a PDF. It uses layout
analysis with sensible defaults to order and group the text in a
sensible way.

The dumppdf.py tool can be used to extract the internal structure from a
PDF. This tool is primarily for debugging purposes, but that can be
useful to anybody working with PDFâ€™s.
