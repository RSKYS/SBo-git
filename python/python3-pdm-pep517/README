python3-pdm-pep517 (Legacy project for pdm-backend.)

This is the backend for PDM projects that is fully-compatible with
PEP 517 spec, but you can also use it alone. It reads the metadata
of PEP 621 format and coverts it to Core metadata.

This package is replaced by python3-pdm-backend, but may still be
required for older python packages.
