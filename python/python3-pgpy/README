PGPy: Pretty Good Privacy for Python

PGPy is a Python library for implementing Pretty Good Privacy into
Python programs, conforming to the OpenPGP specification per RFC 4880.


Currently, PGPy can load keys and signatures of all kinds in both
ASCII armored and binary formats.

It can create and verify RSA, DSA, and ECDSA signatures, at the
moment. It can also encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA and ECDH.
