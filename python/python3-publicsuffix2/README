Get a public suffix for a domain name using the Public Suffix List.
Forked from and using the same API as the publicsuffix package.

This module allows you to get the public suffix, as well as the
registrable domain, of a domain name using the Public Suffix List
from http://publicsuffix.org

A public suffix is a domain suffix under which you can register domain
names, or under which the suffix owner does not control the subdomains
Some examples of public suffixes in the former example are “.com”,
“.co.uk” and “pvt.k12.wy.us”; examples of the latter case are
“github.io” and “blogspot.com”.
