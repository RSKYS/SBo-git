# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pulsectl: python3-pulsectl (Pulse-control Python3 library)
python3-pulsectl:
python3-pulsectl: Python (3.x and 2.x) blocking high-level interface and
python3-pulsectl: ctypes-based bindings for PulseAudio (libpulse), to use in a simple
python3-pulsectl: synchronous code. Wrappers are mostly for mixer-like controls and
python3-pulsectl: introspection-related operations, as opposed to e.g. submitting
python3-pulsectl: sound samples to play and player-like client. For async version to
python3-pulsectl: use with asyncio, see pulsectl-asyncio project instead. Originally
python3-pulsectl: forked from pulsemixer project, which had this code bundled.
