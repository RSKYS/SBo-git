# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pylint: tests you can do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. But
python3-pylint: Pylint offers some more features.

python3-pylint: The big advantage with Pylint is that it is highly configurable,
python3-pylint: customizable, and you can easily write a small plugin to add a
python3-pylint: personal feature.
