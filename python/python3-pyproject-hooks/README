python3-pyproject-hooks (Wrappers to call PEP 517 build backend hooks)

This is a low-level library for calling build-backends in
pyproject.toml-based project. It provides the basic functionality to
help write tooling that generates distribution files from
Python projects.

The pep517 project has been replaced by this project (low level) and
the build project (high level).
