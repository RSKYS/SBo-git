C implementations of functions for use within SABnzbd

This module implements three main sets of C implementations that are
used within SABnzbd:

  * yEnc decoding and encoding using SIMD routines
  * CRC32 calculations
  * Non-blocking SSL-socket reading

Of course, they can also be used in any other application.
