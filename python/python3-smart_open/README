smart_open is a Python 3 library for efficient streaming of very
large files from/to storages such as S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage,
HDFS, WebHDFS, HTTP, HTTPS, SFTP, or local filesystem. It supports
transparent, on-the-fly (de-)compression for a variety of different
formats.

smart_open is a drop-in replacement for Python's built-in open():
it can do anything open can (100% compatible, falls back to native
open whenever possible) plus lots of nifty extra stuff on top.
