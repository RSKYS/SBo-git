The ID3v2 tag format is notorious for its useless specification 
documents and its quirky, mutually incompatible part-implementations. 
Stagger is to provide a robust tagging package that is able to handle 
all the various badly formatted tags out there and allow you to convert
them to a consensus format.
*If you ran into source not found and can't be extracted, make sure it 
starts with release* not the stagger-release*, it's probably because 
you've downloaded from github directly via browser.
