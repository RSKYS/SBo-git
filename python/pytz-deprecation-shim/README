pytz-deprecation-shim (Shims to help you safely remove pytz)

pytz has served the Python community well for many years, but it is no
longer the best option for providing time zones. pytz has a
non-standard interface that is very easy to misuse; this interface was
necessary when pytz was created, because datetime had no way to
represent ambiguous datetimes, but this was solved in Python 3.6,
which added a fold attribute to datetimes in PEP 495. With the
addition of the zoneinfo module in Python 3.9 (PEP 615), there has
never been a better time to migrate away from pytz.
