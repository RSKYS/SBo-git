# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pytz-deprecation-shim:
pytz-deprecation-shim: pytz has served the Python community well for many years, but it is no
pytz-deprecation-shim: longer the best option for providing time zones. pytz has a
pytz-deprecation-shim: non-standard interface that is very easy to misuse; this interface was
pytz-deprecation-shim: necessary when pytz was created, because datetime had no way to
pytz-deprecation-shim: represent ambiguous datetimes, but this was solved in Python 3.6,
pytz-deprecation-shim: which added a fold attribute to datetimes in PEP 495. With the
pytz-deprecation-shim: addition of the zoneinfo module in Python 3.9 (PEP 615), there has
pytz-deprecation-shim: never been a better time to migrate away from pytz.
