wal is a script that takes an image (or a directory of images),
generates a colorscheme (using imagemagick) and then changes all of your
open terminal's colors to the new colorscheme on the fly. wal then
caches each generated colorscheme so that cycling through wallpapers
while changing colorschemes is instantaneous.

Dependencies for wallpaper setting (select one):
  feh, nitrogen, hsetroot, bgs (not available at SBo), habak (not
  available at SBo), or any desktop environment.
