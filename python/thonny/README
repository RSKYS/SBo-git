Thonny is a Python IDE meant for learning programming.

This version does not include python3 but, as it will be installed
to satisfy the dependencies, that should not be a problem.

pygame created with python3 support is an optional dependancy.
esptool is another optional dependancy for communicating with
ROM bootloaders of Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32 chips.
