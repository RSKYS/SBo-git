# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

typed_ast: typed_ast (abstract syntax tree parser)
typed_ast:
typed_ast: typed_ast is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and
typed_ast: Python 3 parser similar to the standard ast library.  Unlike ast, the
typed_ast: parsers in typed_ast include PEP 484 type comments and are independent
typed_ast: of the version of Python under which they are run.  The typed_ast
typed_ast: parsers produce the standard Python AST (plus type comments), and are
typed_ast: both fast and correct, as they are based on the CPython 2.7 and 3.6
typed_ast: parsers.
