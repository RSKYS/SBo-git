vanguards is a controller addon for Tor onion services.

It's aimed at Tor onion services that require high security as
soon as possible, ahead of their official Tor-code releases.

Having Tor installed is not required for building.
The Tor installation does not have to be from SBo.
Vanguards requires Tor 0.3.3.x or above, and Tor 0.3.5.x is
preferred.

A python 3 module will be compiled if python 3 is installed on
the system during compile time.
