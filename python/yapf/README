In essence, the algorithm takes the code and reformats it to
the best formatting that conforms to the style guide, even
if the original code didnâ€™t violate the style guide.

The ultimate goal is that the code YAPF produces is as good
as the code that a programmer would write if they were
following the style guide. It takes away some of the drudgery
of maintaining your code.
