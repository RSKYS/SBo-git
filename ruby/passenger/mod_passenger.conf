# Deploying a web application: an example
# 
# Suppose you have a web application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your
# Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:
# 

#<VirtualHost *:80>
#   ServerName www.yourhost.com
#   # !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
#   DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    
#   <Directory /somewhere/public>
#      # This relaxes Apache security settings.
#      AllowOverride all
#      # MultiViews must be turned off.
#      Options -MultiViews
#
#      Require all granted
#   </Directory>
#</VirtualHost>
