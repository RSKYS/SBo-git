# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rubygem-rack: Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for
rubygem-rack: developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and
rubygem-rack: responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the
rubygem-rack: API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between
rubygem-rack: (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.
