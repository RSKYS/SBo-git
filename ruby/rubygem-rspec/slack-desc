# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rubygem-rspec: rubygem-rspec (BDD for Ruby)
rubygem-rspec:
rubygem-rspec: rspec is a meta-gem, which depends on the rspec-core, rspec-mocks
rubygem-rspec: and rspec-expectations gems. Each of these can be installed
rubygem-rspec: separately and loaded in isolation using require. Among other
rubygem-rspec: benefits, this allows you to use rspec-expectations, for example,
rubygem-rspec: in Test::Unit::TestCase if you happen to prefer that style.
