Sequel is a simple, flexible, and powerful SQL database access toolkit
for Ruby.

This is the legacy 4.x.x. version. For the latest version, see the
'sequel' SlackBuild.

Sequel provides thread safety, connection pooling and a concise DSL for
constructing SQL queries and table schemas. Sequel includes a
comprehensive ORM layer for mapping records to Ruby objects and
handling associated records. Sequel supports advanced database features
such as prepared statements, bound variables, stored procedures,
savepoints, two-phase commit, transaction isolation, master/slave
configurations, and database sharding. Sequel currently has adapters
for ADO, Amalgalite, CUBRID, DataObjects, IBM_DB, JDBC, MySQL, Mysql2,
ODBC, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLAnywhere, SQLite3, Swift, and TinyTDS.
