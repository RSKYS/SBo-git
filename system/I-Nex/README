I-Nex is an application that gathers information for hardware 
components available on your system and displays it using an 
user interface similar to the popular Windows tool CPU-Z.

I-Nex can display information for the following components: 
CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Sound, Hard disks, RAM, Network and USB 
as well as some system info like the hostname, Linux distribution 
and version, Xorg, GCC, GLX versions and Linux Kernel info.
