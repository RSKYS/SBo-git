JetBrainsMono (a typeface for developers)

JetBrains Mono's typeface forms are simple and free from unnecessary
details. Rendered in small sizes, the text looks crisper.

JetBrains Mono italic uses a 9 degree angle; this maintains the
optimal contrast to minimize distraction and eye strain.

138 code-specific ligatures to reduce noise by merging symbols and
removing details so the eyes are processing less.

A radical cut at the end of strokes fits the pixel grid better and
gives the typeface a stricter and more 'tech' personality.
