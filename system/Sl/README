Sl (ls with enhancements)

sl takes the most common use of Unix ls, to display the files in a
directory compactly in multiple columns, and makes it substantially
more useful.

sl groups files by purpose so you can mentally organize many files
quickly; for instance, it collects HTML and PHP files together, as
opposed to leaving them mixed up with supporting images, CSS, and
JavaScript. sl points out interesting files, which include those that
have been recently modified, read relatively recently, are relatively
large, have warnings, or need to be checked in to or out of version
control.

sl is also aesthetically pleasing due to attention to layout and
filtering as well as limiting color and text annotations to salient
information.

Since there's already an "sl" on SlackBuilds.org (in games/), this is
called Sl. If you install it on a system that doesn't have games/sl
installed, a /usr/bin/sl symlink will be created.

The ".sl.tcl" referred to in the documentation is installed in the doc
dir as "sl.tcl.example".
