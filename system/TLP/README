TLP is a command line tool for optimizing power usage, relevant for
laptops.

The default settings are optimized, and customization can be done by
editing TLP's configuration file(s).

Note - Remove any power saving settings/scripts (e.g.: in 
/etc/rc.local), and uninstall laptop-mode-tools to allow TLP to work
properly.

See README.SLACKWARE for post-installation instructions.

Additional configuration is available for Thinkpads.
