Post installation steps:

# Give execute permission to rc.tlp
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.tlp

# Start the tlp service
/etc/rc.d/rc.tlp start

# Restart acpid
/etc/rc.d/rc.acpid restart

# Configure tlp to be run at startup
add "/etc/rc.d/rc.tlp start" (without quotes) to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

After removal of this package you would need to revert the above
changes.  Please make sure that you stopped the TLP service before
removing TLP.

If you have enabled any hooks in /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/ (they are
disabled by default), then the instructions given in the TLP developer
documentation can be followed.
