acefile (extract ACE 1.0 and 2.0 archives)

This single-file, pure python 3, no-dependencies implementation is
intended to be used as a library, but also provides a stand-alone
unace utility. As a mostly pure-python implementation, it is
significantly slower than native implementations, but more robust
against vulnerabilities.

This implementation supports up to version 2.0 of the ACE archive
format, including the EXE, DELTA, PIC and SOUND modes of ACE 2.0,
password protected archives and multi-volume archives. It does not
support writing to archives. It is an implementation from scratch,
based on the 1998 document titled "Technical information of the
archiver ACE v1.2" by Marcel Lemke, using unace 2.5 and WinAce 2.69 by
Marcel Lemke as reference implementations.

Unlike the standard unace, this is Free Software (BSD-licensed).
