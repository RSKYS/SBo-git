# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

acefile: This single-file, pure python 3, no-dependencies implementation is
acefile: intended to be used as a library, but also provides a stand-alone
acefile: unace utility. As a mostly pure-python implementation, it is
acefile: significantly slower than native implementations, but more robust
acefile: against vulnerabilities.
