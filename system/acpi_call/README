Simple kernel module that enables you to call ACPI methods by writing
the method name followed by arguments to /proc/acpi/call. It allows you
to tamper with your system and should be used with CAUTION.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in:

KERNEL=4.4.14 ./acpi_call.SlackBuild
