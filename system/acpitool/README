This is an ACPI client for Linux, written by David Leemans.

This ACPI client is intended to be a replacement for the apm tool.

Even though APM works fine on a lot of laptops, it is deprecated 
and will be replaced by ACPI. Most newer laptops even require ACPI 
to boot properly. As such, it will be nice to have an ACPI client.
