# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

acpitool:
acpitool: This is an ACPI client for Linux, written by David Leemans.
acpitool: This ACPI client is intended to be a replacement for the apm tool.
acpitool: Even though APM works fine on a lot of laptops, it is deprecated and
acpitool: will be replaced by ACPI. Most newer laptops even require ACPI to
acpitool: boot properly. As such, it will be nice to have an ACPI client.
