# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

adobe-source-code-pro-font: adobe-source-code-pro-font (monospaced font)
adobe-source-code-pro-font:
adobe-source-code-pro-font: Source Code Pro was designed by Paul D. Hunt as a companion to
adobe-source-code-pro-font: Source Sans. This complementary family was adapted from the Source
adobe-source-code-pro-font: design due to a request to create a monospaced version for coding
adobe-source-code-pro-font: applications.
