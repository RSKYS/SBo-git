aespipe is a AES encrypting or decrypting pipe. It reads from
standard input and writes to standard output. It can be used to
create and restore encrypted tar or cpio archives, and to 
encrypt and decrypt loop-AES compatible encrypted disk images.

To compile a static binary, pass STATIC=yes to the script.

The script includes runtime support for VIA padlock hardware AES
and Intel hardware AES. Check aespipe.README for other options.
