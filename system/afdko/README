afdko (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType)

The goal of the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType package is to
share the tools used by Adobe font developers for wrapping up
PostScript (i.e. Type1) fonts as OpenType/CFF font files, and adding
OpenType layout features. These tools are used for in-house
development of new Adobe OpenType fonts.

Now that Libreoffice has dropped support for Type1 fonts, one can use
afdko to convert the system Type1 fonts to OTF, which
Libreoffice supports. The package Type1_to_OTF does this.


Notes for x86_64

As received from upstream, adfko forces the building of 32-bit
executables. This is fine on a 32-bit system. On a 64-bit system, the
SlackBuild enables a 64-bit build. This is experimental and unsupported,
but seems to work OK (at least for makeotf and tx).
