# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

afdko: afdko (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType)
afdko:
afdko: The goal of the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType package is to
afdko: share the tools used by Adobe font developers for wrapping up
afdko: PostScript (i.e. Type1) fonts as OpenType/CFF font files, and adding
afdko: OpenType layout features. These tools are used for in-house
afdko: development of new Adobe OpenType fonts.
afdko:
afdko: Now that Libreoffice has dropped support for Type1 fonts, one can use
afdko: the afdko to convert the system Type1 fonts to OTF, which
afdko: Libreoffice supports. The package Type1_to_OTF does this.
