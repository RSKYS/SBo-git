agedu (time-sensitive 'du' utility)

agedu is a utility for tracking down wasted disk space. It does the
same sort of disk scan as du, but it also records the last-access times
of everything it scans. Then it builds an index that lets it
efficiently generate reports giving a summary of the results for each
subdirectory, and then it produces those reports on demand.
