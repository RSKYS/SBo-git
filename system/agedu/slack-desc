# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

agedu: agedu (time-sensitive 'du' utility)
agedu:
agedu: agedu is a utility for tracking down wasted disk space. It does the
agedu: same sort of disk scan as du, but it also records the last-access
agedu: times of everything it scans. Then it builds an index that lets it
agedu: efficiently generate reports giving a summary of the results for
agedu: each subdirectory, and then it produces those reports on demand.
