AIDE is a tool for monitoring file system changes. It can be used
to detect unauthorized monitored files and directories. AIDE was
written to be a simple and free alternative to Tripwire.

This package does not include a default aide.conf file, and it won't
be useful until you write one.

See README.Slackware for configuration hints.
