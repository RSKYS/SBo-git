apg (automated password generator)

apg generates random passwords according to several algorithms. The
default algorithm is pronounceable password generation algorithm
designed by Morrie Gasser and described in 'A Random Word Generator
For Pronounceable Passwords (National Technical Information Service
(NTIS) AD-A-017676)'.

This SlackBuild by default patches apg to use /dev/urandom rather than
/dev/random for generating random seeds, to avoid apg blocking while
waiting for the kernel to gather more entropy. If you're worried about
this being possibly insecure, first read:

Then, if you remain unconvinced, you can run this script with
URANDOM=no in the environment to use /dev/random. Remember, apg is
only using this to generate *seeds* for its own built-in PRNG!
