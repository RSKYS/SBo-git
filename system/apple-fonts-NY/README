Apple New York fonts

These typefaces offer the control and flexibility to optimally display
text at a variety of sizes, in many different languages, across multiple
interfaces.

A companion to San Francisco, this serif typeface is based on essential
aspects of historical type styles. New York features six weights,
supports Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, and features variable
optical sizes allowing it to perform as a traditional reading face at
small sizes and a graphic display face at larger sizes.

This provides the following OTF fonts:
* New York Small
* New York Medium
* New York Large
* New York Extra Large

NOTE:
NewYork.ttf and NewYorkItalic.ttf are not included in the package,
because some programs like OpenOffice have problems with it (crash on
start). In fact, FontForge reports "bad device table" for these.
