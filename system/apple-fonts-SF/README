Apple San Francisco fonts

These typefaces offer the control and flexibility to optimally display
text at a variety of sizes, in many different languages, across multiple
interfaces.

This provides the following OTF fonts:

SF Pro
This neutral, flexible, sans-serif typeface is the system font for iOS,
iPad OS, macOS and tvOS. SF Pro features nine weights, variable optical
sizes for optimal legibility, four widths, and includes a rounded
variant. SF Pro supports over 150 languages across Latin, Greek, and
Cyrillic scripts.

SF Compact
Sharing many features with SF Pro, SF Compact features an efficient,
compact design that is optimized for small sizes and narrow columns. SF
Compact is the system font for watchOS and includes a rounded variant.

SF Mono
This monospaced variant of San Francisco enables alignment between rows
and columns of text, and is used in coding environments like Xcode. SF
Mono features six weights and supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic
scripts.

NOTE:
SF-Compact.ttf, SF-Compact-Italic.ttf, SF-Pro.ttf and SF-Pro-Italic.ttf
are not included in the package, because some programs like OpenOffice
have problems with it (crash on start). In fact, FontForge reports "bad
device table" for these. Same applies for SF Arabic.
