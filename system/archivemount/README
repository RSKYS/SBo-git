archivemount (mounts an archive for access as a file system)

archivemount is a FUSE based file system. Its purpose is to mount
an archive on a mount point where it can be read from or written to
as with any other file system. This makes accessing the contents of
the archive, which may be compressed, transparent to other programs,
without decompressing them.

Supported archive formats: tar, pax, cpio, iso9660 (CD-ROM) images,
zip, shar. Other archive types such as rar and 7z may also work.
