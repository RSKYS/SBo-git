atarisio (peripheral emulator for Atari 8-bit computer and SIO2PC)

AtariSIO allows a Linux system to act as one or more disk drives,
a printer, and/or a cassette drive for an Atari 8-bit (400/800/XL/XE)
computer, using an SIO2PC cable.

Even without SIO2PC or a real Atari, this package includes some
utilities that are useful for manipulating and examining Atari disk,
cassette, and executable images.

AtariSIO can use either a regular serial port or its own kernel
driver. The kernel driver requires a real serial port with a 16550A
UART, which is fairly rare on modern PC hardware. The regular serial
port mode works with most USB serial port adaptors. For best results,
use an FTDI-based adaptor.

By default, the kernel driver is not built because it's not very
useful (or even functional) on modern PCs. To enable it, read the
instructions in "README_kernel.txt".

By default, the atariserver and atarixfer executables are installed
setgid dialout so they can access the serial port, and have the
appropriate capability bits set so they can use realtime scheduling.

If you don't like this, you can set SETGID=no in the script's
environment, and run the programs as root (e.g. with su or sudo).

If you're using a filesystem that doesn't support capabilities,
you can instead set SETUID=yes in the script's environment, to make
atariserver and atarixfer run as root.
