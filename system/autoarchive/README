AutoArchive is a simple utility to help create backups more
easily.  The idea of the program is that all essential information for
creating a single backup---such as list of directories that should be
archived, the archive name, etc.---is stored in a single file -- the
*archive specification file*.  It can use 'tar' for creating archives,
it has a command line interface and supports incremental backups.

Archive specification files, also called ".aa files" are normally
stored in a predefined location from where they are processed by the
"aa" command which results to creating of a corresponding *backup* for
each.

Command "autoarchive" is alias for "aa"; these commands are
equivalent.
