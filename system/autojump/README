Autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by
maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the
command line.  You need to work a little bit before the database
becomes usable. Autojump will listen and rank your 'cd' commands by
frequency. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump"
to a commonly "cd"ed directory.  It supports the bash, zsh, and
tcsh shells.

Additional Installation Steps
------------------------------

Add the following to your .bashrc to enable autojump for your
account:

[[ -s /etc/profile.d/autojump.sh ]] && source /etc/profile.d/autojump.sh

You must open a new shell for autojump to become active.  You may
also need to log in and out of your desktop environment.

The default shell in Slackware is Bash. Further steps may be
required for other shell environments.

Example Usage
--------------

$ cd /tmp
$ cd /home
$ cd /var
$ cd /var/log
$ j tmp
$ j log
$ jo /home
$ j -s

The "j" command drops you back into each directory.  The "jo"
command will launch a file manager for the home directory if
you are using a graphical environment.  Adding "-s" to the "j"
command will list your autojump database.  See the man page
for further details.
