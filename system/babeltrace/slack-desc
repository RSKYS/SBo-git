# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

babeltrace: babeltrace (trace format converter)
babeltrace:
babeltrace: The Babeltrace project provides a library, Python bindings of this
babeltrace: library, as well as a handy little command-line tool aptly named
babeltrace: babeltrace which makes it very easy for mere mortals to view and
babeltrace: convert traces.
babeltrace: Babeltrace is also the reference parser implementation of the Common
babeltrace: Trace Format (CTF), a very versatile trace format. The Babeltrace
babeltrace: library and its Python bindings can read and write CTF traces.
