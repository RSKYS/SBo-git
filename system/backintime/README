Back In Time is a simple backup tool for Linux, inspired by
"flyback project". It provides a command line client 'backintime'
and a Qt5 GUI 'backintime-qt' both written in Python3.

You only need to specify 3 things:

    where to save snapshots
    what folders to back up
    backup frequency (manual, every hour, every day, every month)

The documentation is currently under development in
https://backintime.readthedocs.org/
