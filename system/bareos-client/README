Bareos (Manage backup, recovery) - Client only

Bareos is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system admin) to
manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network
of computers of different kinds. In technical terms, it is a network
Client/Server based backup program. Bareos is relatively easy to use and
efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make
it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design,
Bareos is scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting
of hundreds of computers located over a large network.
