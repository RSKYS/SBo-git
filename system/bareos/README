Bareos (Manage backup, recovery) - Client and server

Bareos is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system admin) to
manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network
of computers of different kinds. In technical terms, it is a network
Client/Server based backup program. Bareos is relatively easy to use and
efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make
it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design,
Bareos is scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting
of hundreds of computers located over a large network.

This script comes with a few options that can be set at build time, one of
which is DATABASE. Supported databases include postgresql, mysql and sqlite3.
By default mysql is selected, to disable or select another database, run:

  DATABASE="" ./bareos.SlackBuild

Some say that having everything under /opt/bareos can be more backup friendly
for disaster recovery situations, and since the official documentation also
mentions this prefix in quite a few places, running the script with:

  OPT_PREFIX=yes ./bareos.SlackBuild

will put (almost) everything into /opt/bareos directory.

Another option worth mentioning is Bat, which by default comes disabled, and
if enabled with BAT=yes variable, creates a package with desktop entries.
Additionally, smtp delivery agent is assumed running on localhost, and job
announcements and core dumps are sent to root@localhost email address. Both
can be changed with EMAIL and SMTPHOST variables.

For more information on upgrading from previous version and from Bacula 
see README.SLACKWARE that came with this package (which is also installed 
with the documentation).
