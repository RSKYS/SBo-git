beebem (BeebEm is a popular Acorn BBC Micro and Master 128 emulator)

This version of BeebEm for UNIX is an SDL port of the Windows version
of BeebEm. To get the menu system for changing settings, loading and
running disc images and so-on, press F12 when the emulater is running.
It's not as polished as the windows version, especially keyboard
mapping is limited to querty, but its better than nothing. enjoy! :-)
