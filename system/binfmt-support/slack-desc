# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

binfmt-support: binfmt-support (script to register interpreters with binfmt_misc)
binfmt-support:
binfmt-support: binfmt-support provides an update-binfmts script with which
binfmt-support: package maintainers can register interpreters to be used with
binfmt-support: this module without having to worry about writing their own
binfmt-support: init.d scripts, and which sysadmins can use for a slightly
binfmt-support: higher-level interface to this module.
