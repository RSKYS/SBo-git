The BitBabbler is a hardware True Random Number Generator (TRNG)
manufactured by Voicetronix of Australia.  This package installs the
software necessary to control and test White and Black BB devices.

Socket control of BitBabbler devices is granted to group bit-babbler
by default.  You can create it after installation like so:
  groupadd bit-babbler
OR choose another suitable group (eg, wheel) when building:
  BBGROUP="wheel" sh bit-babbler.SlackBuild

Please see README.Slackware for additional installation tips.
