brightnessctl (cli device brightness control)

This program allows you read and control device brightness. Devices,
by default, include backlight and LEDs (searched for in corresponding
classes). If omitted, the first found device is selected.

Includes application, man-page, and installs a udev rule so
non-root users can control the backlight.
