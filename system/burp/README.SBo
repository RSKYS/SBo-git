To start the burp server run

  /etc/rc.d/rc.burp start

To start burp automatically on boot up, add these lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

  # Start burp
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.burp ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.burp start
  fi

and the following lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown to stop burp on shutdown

  # Stop burp
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.burp ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.burp stop
  fi

Naturally, ensure that all these scripts have executable permissions.
