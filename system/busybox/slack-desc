# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

busybox: busybox (The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux)
busybox:
busybox: BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
busybox: single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the
busybox: utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The
busybox: utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
busybox: full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
busybox: provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their
busybox: GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for
busybox: any small or embedded system.
