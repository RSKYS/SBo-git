c-icap is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be used with HTTP
proxies that support the ICAP protocol to implement content adaptation
and filtering services.

In order to start c-icap at boot and stop it properly at shutdown,
make sure rc.c-icap is executable and add the following lines to
the following files:

        /etc/rc.d/rc.local
        ==================
        # Startup c-icap
        if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.c-icap ]; then
                /etc/rc.d/rc.c-icap start
        fi

        /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
        ===========================
        # Stop c-icap
        if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.c-icap ]; then
                /etc/rc.d/rc.c-icap stop
        fi
