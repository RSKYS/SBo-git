Caprice32 - Amstrad CPC Emulator
(c) Copyright 1997-2004 Ulrich Doewich

..........................................................................

WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home computer
series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128
models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a low
level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with original
CPC software. These programs or games can be run unmodified at real-time
or higher speeds, depending on the emulator host environment.


..........................................................................

USAGE
~~~~~

This is considered and alpha release, as the emulator in its current
state lacks a lot of user friendliness (i.e. it lacks a graphical user
interface).

Open cap32.cfg in a text editor (Notepad for example) and edit values as
necessary. Refer to the next section for an explanation of what it all
means. Make especially sure the rom path reference is correct otherwise
the emulator will fail to start!

To load a disk, snapshot or tape image simply specify the complete path
to the file on the command line. You can pass more than one type of file
at the same time - simply separate them with spaces. Paths and filenames
that contain spaces need to be enclosed by quotes.
