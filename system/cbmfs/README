cbmfs can mount your 8-bit Commodore disk images into your local
filesystem. Currently d64, d71, d81, d80, d82 images are supported in
read and write mode.

cbmfs tries to resemble the commodore filetype by setting some unix
access permissions. If you change the file permissions on unix with
chmod you can alter the commodore file type.
