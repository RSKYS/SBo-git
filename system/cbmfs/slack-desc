# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cbmfs: filesystem. Currently d64, d71, d81, d80, d82 images are supported in
cbmfs: read and write mode.
cbmfs:
cbmfs: cbmfs tries to resemble the commodore filetype by setting some unix
cbmfs: access permissions. If you change the file permissions on unix with
cbmfs: chmod you can alter the commodore file type.
