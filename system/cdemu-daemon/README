CDEmu daemon is the userspace daemon part of the cdemu suite.
a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.

This SlackBuild uses group cdrom as default.
To use another group (e.x. cdemu), add its name as an
argument to the GROUP variable when running the build script.
For example:

GROUP=cdemu ./cdemu-daemon.SlackBuild
