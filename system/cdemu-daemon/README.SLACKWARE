To start the cdemu-daemon at boot, add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

# Start cdemu-daemon.
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.cdemud ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.cdemud start
fi

Add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (if this file does not already
exist, create it and make it executable):

# Stop cdemu-daemon.
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.cdemud ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.cdemud stop
fi
