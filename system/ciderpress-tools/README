ciderpress-tools (tools for working with Apple II disk images)

CiderPress is a Windows utility for managing Apple II file archives
and disk images. The application has not been ported to Linux, but it
ships with various command-line tools which have been ported. This
package contains cider-getfile, cider-iconv, cider-makedisk,
cider-mdc, cider-packddd, and cider-sstasm.

See /usr/doc/ciderpress-tools-4.1.0_d3/README-linux.md for usage.
Note that the tools are installed with the cider- prefix, to avoid
conflicts.
