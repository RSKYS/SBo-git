CliFM is a Command Line Interface File Manager: all input and 
interaction is performed via commands. This is its main feature and 
strength.
Unlike most terminal file managers out there, indeed, CliFM replaces 
the traditional TUI interface also known as curses or text-menu based 
interface by a command-line interface (CLI),1 also known as REPL.2

If working with the command-line, your workflow is not affected at all, 
but just enriched with file management functionalities: automatic files 
listing, files selection, bookmarks, tags, directory jumper, directory 
and commands history, auto-cd and auto-open, bulk rename, TAB 
completion, autosuggestions, and a trash system, among other features. 
In this sense, CliFM is certainly a file manager, but also a shell 
extension.
