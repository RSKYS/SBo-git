RPM metadata generator.

Since we have very basic support of rpm in Slackware
base, why not ship this utilities too?

This is C implementation of createrepo.

With this utility you can run repository of your own RPM
package set.

Please note that deltarpm in this package is off as it very
rare cases where it used in practice because of difficulties
in support this case on repo side.
