New in 0.8: I've added symbols for BackSpace and Delete. But
more important, I've added two new ways to specify characters.

You can specify characters by symbol using \( and \), using
the symbol definitions from /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h. For
example, \(BackSpace\) would insert a backspace character.

You can also specify control characters using the up-caret ^
character. So you could get that same backspace character with ^H.

0.8.1 just fixes a new compiler warning, no functional changes.
0.8.2 adds -lXext to the link line -- some systems added that
    automatically, but making it explicit is better.
0.8.3 adds a bunch more new ways to specify characters, fixes
    some bugs, and switches back to XTest as the default (use
    -x to use XSendEvent).

I also have a new, experimental, Python version called pykey,
which requires the python-xlib library. It might be useful for
people who don't have a compiler installed, or as a demo of how
to generate key events in python-xlib. Try it out: pykey-0.1.
