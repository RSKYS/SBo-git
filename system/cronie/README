cronie (The standard UNIX cron daemon)

Cronie contains the standard UNIX daemon crond that runs specified
programs at scheduled times and related tools. It is based on the
original cron and has security and configuration enhancements like the
ability to use pam and SELinux.

By default this SlackBuild will include anacron in the package. If you
don't want this, pass ANACRON=no to the SlackBuild.

Note that Slackware has dcron - Dillon's Cron daemon. This package will
conflict with dcron, so it is advised to remove dcron before installing
cronie:

  Stop the dcron daemon and remove the dcron package:
  # /etc/rc.d/rc.crond stop
  # removepkg dcron
  # rm -rf /var/spool/cron
