# /etc/default/crond from SlackBuilds.org cronie package.
# The default Slackware version of this file has this:
#CROND_OPTS="-l notice"
# ...which doesn't do anything in cronie's crond, though it's
# been patched to accept (and ignore) the -l option so it can
# work with dcron's leftover config file.

# Default is, no options at all:
CROND_OPTS=""
