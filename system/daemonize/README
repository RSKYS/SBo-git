Daemonize allows you to run a command as a Unix daemon.

See man page for usage after installation.

Builds from hosted snapshot of git repo. See home page
from daemonize.info for latest version information.

To build a later version if available, clone it with:

git clone git://github.com/bmc/daemonize.git

Then read the CHANGES.md file to find the release version.
Change the directory name from daemonize to daemonize-x.y.z
and create a daemonize-x.y.z.tar.gz file from that folder.

You may then build with: VERSION=x.y.z ./daemonize.SlackBuild
