daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.

supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the
service if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise
needs is a directory with a run script that runs the service.

multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally
timestamps each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines
matching specified patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the
amount of disk space used. If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries
again, without losing any data.

Also included are svscan (starts one supervise process for each
service), svscanboot (run by init to start svscan in the /service
directory), readproctitle (show error messages in ps o/p) and many
others. See the home page for a list and for documentation.

This package differs from the daemontools package in that
it installs the binaries to /usr/bin instead of /command.

daemontools is written by D. J. Bernstein.

See README.Slackware on how to use it after installation.
