Detox is a utility designed to clean up filenames. It replaces
difficult to work with characters, such as spaces, with standard
equivalents. It will also clean up filenames with UTF-8 or Latin-1
(or CP-1252) characters in them.  Some features include:

* Removal or replacement of upper ASCII Latin-1 (ISO8859-1) 
characters (i.e. left facing and right facing double quotes).
Whenever possible a replacement character will be used (i.e. an 
"A" will take the place of an "A" with an accent mark over it).
* Removal or replacement of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters.
This operates along the same line as the ISO 8859-1 translation, 
except the scope of Unicode is much larger
* Removal or replacement of spaces and other potentially tricky 
characters, such as (, ), and @. Removal of any "-"s at the 
beginning of the filename
* Removal or replacement of CGI escaped ASCII characters, i.e. 
%20 becomes " " (which then becomes "_").
* Trimming of excessive "_" and "-"s.
* Directory recursion, dry runs, verbose listings.  
* It's designed with safety in mind. It won't overwrite to a 
file that already exists, and it doesn't touch special files 
normally (but it can be asked to).

Global configuration is in /etc/detoxrc, user-specific configuration
can be specified in ~/.detoxrc. A sample configuration file is
provided (/etc/detoxrc.sample).
