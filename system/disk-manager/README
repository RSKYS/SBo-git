disk-manager (simple filesystem configurator)

Disk manager is a simple filesystem configurator that allows you to:

* Automatically detect new partitions at startup.
* Fully manage configuration of filesystem.
* Enable/disable write support for NTFS (needs ntfs-3g installed).

NOTE: for your authentication you can use another tool instead of gksu,
there are: ktsuss, xfsudo or kdesu.
