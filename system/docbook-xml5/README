'docbook-xml5' is a group of shell scripts and 
required files used for creating a removable 
SlackBuild package for DocBook5 XML dtd and schemas
with XML stylesheets in a namespace.

After the installation of the DocBook5 XML dtd and schemas
with XML stylesheets in a namespace /etc/xml/docbook 
catalog file will be created if it DOESN'T exist otherwise
it will be updated accordingly depending on the installation
state of the 'docbookMathML1mods' package. Also following
symbolic links will be created for the XML stylesheets
that must be used with DocBook5 XML dtd and schemas:

    /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl-ns
    /usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-ns-stylesheets

After uninstallation of the 'docbook-xml5' package
/etc/xml/docbook and /usr/share/xml/ will be reset
automatically to the original state defined by the 
'linuxdoc-tools'
