Docker Compose v2 (Utility for running containers on Docker)

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications on
Docker defined using the Compose file format. A Compose file is used to
define how one or more containers that make up your application are
configured. Once you have a Compose file, you can create and start your
application with a single command: docker compose up.

Docker Compose V2 is a major version bump release of Docker Compose. It
has been completely rewritten from scratch in Golang (V1 was in Python).
The installation instructions for Compose V2 differ from V1. V2 is not a
standalone binary anymore, and installation scripts will have to be
adjusted. Some commands are different.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
