DOSbox is a DOS emulator/virtual machine for X11 and Unix.
It allows you to play many of the old games you grew up loving,
as well as many apps designed to run on DOS.

SDL_sound is an optional dependency.

This is the latest-or-almost development version, hence it is not labeled
stable by upstream.
dosbox-dev does conflict with the stable dosbox 0.74 Slackbuild, and isn't
meant to be used alongside.
If you want to have both dosbox and dosbox-dev packages installed set
DOSBOXDEV=yes, and man page, icon, desktop entry and dosbox binary will be
renamed dosbox-dev.

If you want to use another revision of the SVN codebase,
get it and put it in a directory called dosbox-dev, then create a
dosbox-dev-0.74.rXXXX.tar.xz archive.
After that you can do REVISION=XXXX ./dosbox-dev.SlackBuild
There'll be some available at :
https://sourceforge.net/projects/slackbuildsdirectlinks/files/dosbox/

For example for the latest available revision :
# svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/dosbox/code-0/dosbox/trunk dosbox-dev
# REVISION=$(cd dosbox-dev && LANG=C svn info | grep "Revision"| cut -d' ' -f2)
# tar cfa dosbox-dev-0.74.r$REVISION.tar.xz dosbox-dev/
# ./dosbox-dev.SlackBuild
