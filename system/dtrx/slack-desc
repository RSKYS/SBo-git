# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dtrx: dtrx extracts archives in a number of different formats.
dtrx: In addition to providing one command to handle many different archive
dtrx: types, dtrx also aids the user by extracting contents consistently.
dtrx: By default, everything will be written to a dedicated directory
dtrx: that's named after the archive.  dtrx will also change the
dtrx: permissions to ensure that the owner can read and write all those
dtrx: files.
