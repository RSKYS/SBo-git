Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to
be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or
other storage medium.  Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup.

The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can
restore a full backup of a filesystem. Single files and directory
subtrees may also be restored from full or partial backups in
interactive mode.

Slackware's tar package already has rmt, therefore this SlackBuild
excludes it.

This SlackBuild disables the SELinux functionality and dependency.

Note that Slackware comes with another "restore" command:
/usr/sbin/restore The package built by this SlackBuild however will
install: /sbin/restore Thus you might need to call the dump package
restore by its full path.
