dump (dump and restore backup commands)

Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to
be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or
other storage medium. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup.

The restore.dump command performs the inverse function of dump;
it can restore a full backup of a filesystem. Single files and
directory subtrees may also be restored from full or partial backups
in interactive mode.

and the counter-argument on:

Slackware's tar package already has rmt, therefore this SlackBuild
excludes it. It also has a "restore" command, so dump's restore
command (and man page) has been renamed "restore.dump".

This SlackBuild disables the SELinux functionality and dependency.
