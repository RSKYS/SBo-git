# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dump: dump (dump and restore backup commands)
dump:
dump: Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to
dump: be backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or
dump: other storage medium. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
dump: layered on top of the full backup.
dump:
dump: The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can
dump: restore a full backup of a filesystem. Single files and directory
dump: subtrees may also be restored from full or partial backups in
dump: interractive mode.
