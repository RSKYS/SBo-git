duply - A shell front end for duplicity

duply is a frontend for the mighty duplicity magic. duplicity is a
python based shell application that makes encrypted incremental
backups to remote storage. Different backends liek ftp, sftp, imap,
s3 and others are supported.

duply simplifies running duplicity with cron or on command line by:
- keeping recurring settings in profiles per backup job
- automated import/export of keys between profile and keyring
- enabling batch operations eg. backup_verify_purge
- executing pre/post scripts
- precondition checking for flawless duplicity operation

For S3 support install boto
