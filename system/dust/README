Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are
using disk space without requiring sort or head. Dust will print a
maximum of one 'Did not have permissions' message.

Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the
biggest subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree
to find the larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h'
flag. The largest subdirectories will be colored.
