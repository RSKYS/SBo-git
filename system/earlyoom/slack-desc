# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

earlyoom: earlyoom (the early out-of-memory daemon)
earlyoom:
earlyoom: earlyoom is a userspace daemon that can be triggered earlier than the
earlyoom: kernel's OOM-killer. It checks the amount of available memory and free
earlyoom: swap up to 10 times a second (less often if there is a lot of free
earlyoom: memory). By default if both are below 10%, it will kill the largest
earlyoom: process (highest oom_score). The percentage value is configurable via
earlyoom: command line arguments.
