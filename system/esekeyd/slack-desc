# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

esekeyd:
esekeyd: ESE Key Daemon is a multimedia keyboard daemon for Linux. With
esekeyd: the 2.6 kernel series it can also handle remote controls, as they
esekeyd: are presented as keyboards. It's a userspace program that polls
esekeyd: /dev/input/event? interfaces for incoming keypresses, and executes
esekeyd: commands as defined in its config file.
esekeyd:
esekeyd: esekeyd is also useful for keyboards without multimedia keys. Its
esekeyd: functionality is similar to xbindkeys, but it doesn't require X
esekeyd: (works in the console).
