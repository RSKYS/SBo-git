# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

etckeeper: mercurial, darcs, or bzr repository. It tracks file metadata that
etckeeper: revison control systems do not normally support, but that is
etckeeper: important for /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow. It's
etckeeper: quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if
etckeeper: you understand the basics of working with revision control.
