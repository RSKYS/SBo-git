etsh (extended Thompson shell)

Etsh(1) is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the Sixth Edition
Thompson shell. Tsh(1) is an unenhanced port of the shell, and glob(1)
is a port of its global command. Together, tsh and glob provide a user
interface which is backward compatible with that provided by the Sixth
Edition Thompson shell and global command, but without the obvious
enhancements found in etsh.

The original Thompson shell was principally written by Ken Thompson of
Bell Labs.

etsh was formerly known as "osh".

The package includes v6scripts and looptest.
