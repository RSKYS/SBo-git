The Extensible Virtual Display Interface (EVDI) is a Linux kernel
module that enables management of multiple screens, allowing user-space
programs to take control over what happens with the image. It is
essentially a virtual display you can add, remove and receive screen
updates for, in an application that uses the libevdi library.
