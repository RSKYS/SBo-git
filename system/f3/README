F3 (Fix Fake Flash) is an open source Linux software to test flash
memory capacity. There are two programs, one to read and one to
write files to the item being tested.

ALL of these programs should probably be run as root !

Also  included are experimental programs f3probe, f3brew, and f3fix.
To include f3probe, f3brew, and f3fix in the SlackBuild Package:

   EXTRA=YES ./f3.Slackbuild

The author also included two shell script wrappers that
will be installed as /usr/doc/f3-7.0/{log-f3wr,f3write.h2w}

In order to use these scripts as is, they must be moved to /usr/bin/
