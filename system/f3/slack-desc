# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

f3: f3 (Fight Flash Fraud)
f3:
f3: F3 is an open source Linux software to test flash memory capacity.
f3:
f3: F3 is composed of two binaries: f3write, and f3read. f3write fills a
f3: file system up with 1GB files named NNNN.fff, where N is a number,
f3: whereas, f3read validates those files.  If the content of all NNNN.fff
f3: files is valid, the memory is fine.  The last file may be less than
f3: 1GB since f3write takes all available space for data.
