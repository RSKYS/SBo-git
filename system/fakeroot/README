Fakeroot makes it possible to run commands in an environment faking
root privileges. This is done by setting LD_PRELOAD to libfakeroot.so,
which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod, stat, and
so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.

po4a is optional, auto-detected dependency, needed for building
non-English man pages. You can skip building them by means of:

  MANPO=no ./fakeroot.SlackBuild

Passing MANPO=yes will make the script fail if po4a is not installed.
