fasd (Command-line productivity booster)

Fasd (pronounced similar to "fast") is a command-line productivity
booster. Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX
shells. It is inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps
track of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can
quickly reference them in the command line.

The name fasd comes from the default suggested aliases f(files),
a(files/directories), s(show/search/select), d(directories).

Fasd ranks files and directories by "frecency," that is, by both
"frequency" and "recency." The term "frecency" was first coined by
Mozilla and used in Firefox.
