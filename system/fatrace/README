fatrace reports file access events from all running processes.
Its main purpose is to find processes which keep waking up the disk
unnecessarily and thus prevent some power saving.

Included is a python3 script called "power-usage-report", which uses
fatrace and powertop to build a textual report from one minute of
measuring power usage and file accesses. This does not take any
arguments or requires any interactivity, so is very simple to use and
serves as a starting point for bug reports or optimizing a particular
installation.
