Fcron is a periodical command scheduler which aims at replacing 
Vixie Cron and Anacron.

Fcron works well on systems that are not continuously running such
as laptops or desktops and it is loaded with features.

When a machine is powered on, Fcron can start jobs that were
skipped while the machine was powered off.

Installation notes:
-------------------
Group fcron and user fcron must exist before installation.
So as root do this:
  groupadd -g 289  fcron
  useradd  -u 289 -g fcron -d /var/spool/fcron -M -s /bin/false fcron

Post Installation notes:
------------------------
The Fcron installation creates a startup file called /etc/rc.d/rc.fcron

To run this startup file automatically at system startup time,
add an entry to the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:

  # start fcron as a replacement for cron
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.fcron ]; then
        . /etc/rc.d/rc.fcron start
  fi

To prevent the automatic startup of the existing crond daemon:

  1) Turn off the execute bit on the crond binary:

     chmod -x /usr/sbin/crond

And/or:
  2) Comment out the crond code in /etc/rc.d/rc.M

     #if [ -x /usr/sbin/crond ]; then
     #  /usr/sbin/crond -l notice
     #fi

To create an fcrontab for root from the sample-root-fcrontab.txt file:

  fcrontab sample-root-fcrontab.txt
