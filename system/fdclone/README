fdclone (two-pane textmode file manager)

FDclone is a file & directory maintenance tool for UNIX-based OSes. It
is a clone of "FD" for MS-DOS, made by Mr. A.Idei in 1989.

fdclone has excellent Japanese language UI, documentation, and
character encoding support, since it originates in Japan.

The executable is installed as /usr/bin/fdclone, which means this
build doesn't conflict with system/fd. However, if you don't have fd
installed, a symlink /usr/bin/fd is created so you can just type "fd"
to run this.
