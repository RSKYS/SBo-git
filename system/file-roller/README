File-roller is an archive manager for the GNOME environment. It allows
you to:

 * Create and modify archives
 * View and search the content of an archive
 * View a file contained in an archive
 * Extract files from the archive

File-roller supports the following formats:

 * Tar (.tar) archives, including those compressed with
   gzip (.tar.gz, .tgz), bzip (.tar.bz, .tbz), bzip2 (.tar.bz2, .tbz2),
   compress (.tar.Z, .taz), lzop (.tar.lzo, .tzo) and lzma (.tar.lzma)
 * Zip archives (.zip)
 * Jar archives (.jar, .ear, .war)
 * 7z archives (.7z)
 * iso9660 CD images (.iso)
 * Lha archives (.lzh)
 * Single files compressed with gzip (.gz), bzip (.bz), bzip2 (.bz2),
   compress (.Z), lzop (.lzo) and lzma (.lzma)

File-roller doesn't perform archive operations by itself, but relies on
standard tools for this.

It integrates well in Thunar (XFCE) using Thunar-Archive-Plugin.
