filerunner (two-pane graphical file manager)

FileRunner is a very configurable two-pane file manager for Unix and
Windows systems. It is simple and efficient and has a built-in FTP/SFTP
client.

FileRunner's config files can be found in ~/.config/.fr.

Note: the FileRunner executable is normally called /usr/bin/fr. I've
renamed it to /usr/bin/filerunner, since there's already a system/fr
package that installs a /usr/bin/fr. If system/fr is not installed,
you'll get a /usr/bin/fr symlink to filerunner.
