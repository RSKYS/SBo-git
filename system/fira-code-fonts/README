Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of
ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is
just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains
ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For
some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct
spacing.
