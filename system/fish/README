fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)

fish is a user friendly command line shell for UNIX-like systems.  fish
includes case insensitive completions, a multiline editing system, a new
and simplified key binding system, and a large number of command
specific completions.

This package will potentially conflict with the /usr/games/fish binary
from the y/bsdgames package.  In a stock installation with default PATH
ordering, /usr/bin should be checked before /usr/games, so it shouldn't
be an issue, but we thought it was worth noting just in case.

sphinx is an optional dependency.

NOTES:

This SlackBuild automatically adds fish to /etc/shells.

To use fish as your login shell, run this command:

 $ chsh -s /usr/bin/fish

To remove it from the /etc/shells (in case of fish removal), run:

 $ su -c "sed -ri '\|^/usr/bin/fish$|d' /etc/shells"

To use fish_update_completions see README.Slackware from man-db
SlackBuild or typically (as normal user or root):

 $ fish
 $ source /etc/profile.d/man-db.sh
 $ fish_update_completions

If you are upgrading from version 3.0.0 or before, please also review
