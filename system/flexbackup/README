Flexbackup is for you if you have a single or small number of
machines, amanda is "too much", and tarring things up by hand isn't
nearly enough.

Features:
 o Easy to configure
 o Uses dump, afio, GNU tar, cpio, star, pax, or zip archivers
 o Full and numbered levels of incremental backup (acts like "dump")
 o Compression and buffering options for all backup types
 o Does remote filesystems (over rsh/ssh; no special service)
 o Package delta mode can backup files not owned by rpm, or owned+changed files.
 o Writes to tapes, on-disk archive files, or on-disk directory trees
 o Keeps a table of contents so you know what archives are on each tape
 o Nice log files

After installing, read the README for information on how to use.
