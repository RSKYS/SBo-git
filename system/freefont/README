GNU FreeFont is a free family of scalable outline fonts, suitable for
general use on computers and for desktop publishing.  It is Unicode
encoded for compatibility with all modern operating systems.

Besides a full set of characters for writing systems based on the Latin
alphabet, FreeFont contains symbol characters and characters from other
writing systems.

This SlackBuild sets the "sans", "serif" and "monspace" font aliases to
FreeSans, FreeSerif, and FreeMono; to disable this, remove the symlink 
at /etc/fonts/conf.d/35-freefont.conf
