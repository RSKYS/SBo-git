fsviewer (NextStep-like file browser)

FSViewer is a file system viewer for Window Maker, developed by George
Clernon visually and functionally in analogy to the Workspace Manager
of NeXTStep(TM).

Although fsviewer uses windowmaker's libraries, it will run under any
X window manager or desktop environment.
