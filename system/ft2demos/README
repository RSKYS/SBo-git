and debugging problems with fonts (or with freetype itself). Includes
these tools:

ftdump   - simple font dumper
ftgamma  - screen gamma calibration helper
ftgrid   - simple glyph grid viewer
ftlint   - simple font tester
ftmemchk - simple memory tester (tests FreeType's memory allocator)
ftmulti  - multiple masters font viewer
ftpatchk - tests whether patented hinting is necessary
ftstring - string viewer (displays text in specified font)
fttimer  - simple performance timer
ftvalid  - font layout table validator
ftview   - simple glyph viewer
ttdebug  - a TrueType bytecode debugger

Most of the commands have man pages. Also most of the commands show
usage info if you run them with --help (or with no arguments).

This package is known as "freetype2-demos" on Arch and Debian systems.
