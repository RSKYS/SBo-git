fuse-archive (FUSE file system for archives and compressed files)

fuse-archive is a program that serves an archive or compressed file
(e.g. foo.tar, foo.tar.gz, foo.xz or foo.zip) as a read-only FUSE file
system.

It is similar to mount-zip and fuse-zip but speaks a larger range of
of archive or compressed file formats.

It is similar to archivemount but can be much faster, although it can
only mount read-only, not read-write.
