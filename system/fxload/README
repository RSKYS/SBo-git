FXLOAD is conveniently able to download firmware into FX, FX2,
and FX2LP EZ-USB devices, as well as the original AnchorChips EZ-USB.
It is intended to be invoked by hotplug scripts when the unprogrammed
device appears on the bus.

Primarily as an aid for developers, this can also be used to update
firmware on devices which boot from I2C serial EEPROMs.  For that
use, as well as downloading firmware to all other off-chip memory,
a second stage loader must first be downloaded.

The distribution includes "a3load.hex", which is a simple second stage
loader that works with all the EZ-USB products listed above.  If you
want to write to an EEPROM, you can use the appropriate version of the
"Vend_Ax" code provided with the Cypress developer kit.
