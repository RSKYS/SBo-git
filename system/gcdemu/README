gCDEmu provides a graphic interface that allows performing the key tasks
related to controlling the CDEmu daemon, such as loading and unloading
devices, displaying devices' status and retrieving/setting devices'
debug masks.

In addition, the applet listens to signals emitted by CDEmu daemon and
provides notifications via libnotify.
