Gentoo is a graphical file management program, written from
scratch in C. It uses the GTK+ toolkit for its interface.
gentoo is developed and tested primarily under Linux, but is
known to compile and work on many other Unix-like operating
systems as well.

One of the design goals with gentoo has been to provide
extensive customization and configuration abilities, and to do
so from an integrated, graphic, interface. The user should not
have to edit the configuration file directly "by hand", and
especially not have to restart the program for changes to take
effect.

gentoo features a fairly complex and powerful system
for file type recognition, coupled to an object-oriented style
system, which together give you a lot of control over how files
of different types are displayed and acted upon.
