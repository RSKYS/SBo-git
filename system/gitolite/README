gitolite (Hosting git repositories)

Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with very
fine-grained access control and many (many!) more powerful features.

This script expects and offers commands to create 'gitolite' user and a
group. Switching to a more popular username, such as 'git', is done by
running the script like this:

  GL_USER=git GL_GROUP=git ./gitolite.SlackBuild

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
