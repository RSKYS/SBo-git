It is written in bash and it comes with an installer to make it run
everyday automatically. his script writes some general infos about files
permission, socket, ownership etc...

set-uid files, world writable files, symlinks nouser files, etc.
Since the 1.1 version, Glyptodon also scan the system for threats linked
to POSIX file capabilities.
