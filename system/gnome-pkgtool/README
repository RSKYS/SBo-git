This is a GTK+ front-end to the Slackware package management tools
(pkgtool). With gnome-pkgtool you can do the following actions to your
Slackware Linux installation:

- Install .t?z packages
- Uninstall installed packages
- Re-install/upgrade installed packages
- Inspect packages content

For its function, gnome-pkgtool relies on installpkg and removepkg
tools for installing and uninstalling packages.

Upon start, gnome-pkgtool goes though /var/lib/pkgtools/packages/, so it
may take some time to appear.

NOTE!
This program is from 2004. It seems to work fine, but keep it in mind.
The option to build packages is deprecated (requires checkinstall), so
it is patched out.
