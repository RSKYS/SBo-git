The GNU unifont has a glyph for every printable code point in the
Unicode Basic Multilinguial Plane(BMP). The BMP is the first Unicode
"plane" of 65,536(16bit) code points, and includes character encoding
for most of the world's modern scripts.

By default, the package will include precompiled versions of the font in
OTF (OpenType), TTF (TrueType), PCF (X Window bitmap), PSF (console) and
OTB (OpenType Bitmap) formats. This can be changed using FONTFORMATS
environment variable, which should be set to comma-separated list of
font formats to be included in the package.

Available formats are:

otf = OpenType
ttf = TrueType
pcf = X Window bitmap
psf = Console fonts
otb = OpenType Bitmap fonts, compatible with recent versions of Pango
      which don't support BDF/PCF fonts. Fonts in this format are
      generated by converting precompiled BDF/PCF fonts using fonttosfnt
      tool.

For example, setting FONTFORMATS=pcf,psf will include only PCF and PSF
fonts in the package. If FONTFORMATS variable is not set then the
default value "otf,ttf,pcf,psf,otb" is assumed.
