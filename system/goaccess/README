Goaccess is an open source real-time Apache log analyser and
interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems.
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system
administrators that require a visual server report on the
fly.

Optional:

Goaccess supports two types of GeoIP - legacy and mmdb.

If you want to add GeoIP support, pass either option to the
slackbuild:

GEOIP=legacy ./goaccess.SlackBuild
(Requires GeoIP)

GEOIP=mmdb ./goaccess.SlackBuild
(Requires libmaxminddb)

TokyoCabinet:

Goaccess supports Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Cabinet's on-disk
B+ Tree database.

The options are:

TCB=memhash ./goaccess.SlackBuild
TCB=btree ./goaccess.SlackBuild
(Both require tokyocabinet)
