You can put an entry into /etc/fstab (please adapt the mount options to
your needs):

   gphotofs /media/camera fuse users,rw,noauto,defaults 0   0

Make sure in that case /media/camera exists:

   [ -d /media/camera ] || mkdir /media/camera

Now you should be able to mount your camera by simpy issuing:

   mount /media/camera

(This bit of documentation was borrowed from the Debian gphotofs package,
with thanks)
