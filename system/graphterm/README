GraphTerm is a browser-based graphical terminal interface, that
aims to seamlessly blend the command line and graphical user
interfaces. You can use it just like a regular terminal,
backwards-compatible with xterm, and access the additional
graphical features as needed. These features can help impove your
terminal workflow by integrating clickable folder navigation with
command line operations and
letting you view image/HTML output without a separate window.
You can use the GraphTerm API to build "mashups" of web applications
that work seamlessly within the terminal.
