GRUB4DOS is a universal boot loader based on GNU GRUB, with bugfixes 
and new features such as built-in BIOS disk emulation, ATAPI CDROM
driver, and Chinese support. It can be loaded from DOS/LINUX,
via Windows boot manager/syslinux/lilo, or from MBR/CD.

To package the Chinese version, run the script like this:
CHINESE="yes" ./grub4dos.SlackBuild

You can chainload Grub4dos from LILO with an entry like:
image = /boot/grub.exe
  label = Grub4dos

Read the Grub4dos guide for information on installing/using Grub4dos:

Note: bootlace.com is a 32-Bit binary.
It will not run on a pure x86_64 system

Note2: Though grub4dos has ext4 support, its MBR code CANNOT load
grldr (The main boot loader file) from an ext4 partition.
