HAL is a hardware abstraction layer that is no longer used on modern
Linux systems - with the advent of tools such as UDev and UDisks the
same and improved functionality is provided by other means.
The flash plugin currently requires libhal for playback of DRM
content. This library provides a compatibility layer and minimal
libhal implementation for that purpose. This library does NOT
provide a full HAL interface or daemon.
