# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hal-flash: hal-flash (HAL stub library for playing DRM flash content)
hal-flash:
hal-flash: HAL is a hardware abstraction layer that is no longer used on modern
hal-flash: Linux systems - with the advent of tools such as UDev and UDisks the
hal-flash: same and improved functionality is provided by other means.
hal-flash: The flash plugin currently requires libhal for playback of DRM
hal-flash: content. This library provides a compatibility layer and minimal
hal-flash: libhal implementation for that purpose. This library does NOT
hal-flash: provide a full HAL interface or daemon.
