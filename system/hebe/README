Hebe is a KDE front-end GUI for the Hercules z/Arch emulator. It was designed
to have a modern look; there are no dials! Hebe provides two consoles, one for
Hercules and one for the SCP (system control program), AKA, the operating
system. Input is automatically routed to the correct receiver. You can start
as many instances of Hercules as your hardware can support.
