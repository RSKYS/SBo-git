heirloom-ed is a version of the standard text editor derived from
the original UNIX source code released by Caldera and Sun and
collected under The Heirloom Toolchest project's umbrella.

This SlackBuild will by default install ed under name heirloom-ed
in order to neither conflict with GNU ed as supplied by
Slackware nor use PATH overrides created by other heirloom
SlackBuilds.

If you pass ALLEDS=yes to the script, additional variants of ed
will be built correspoding to various Unices. They will be
installed under names such as heirloom-ed_sus.

If you pass STATIC=yes, the resulting binaries will not be
dynamically linked (not that there's much to link against beyond
libc).
