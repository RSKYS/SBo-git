The Heirloom Bourne Shell is a portable variant of the traditional Unix
shell. It has been derived from OpenSolaris code and thus implements the
SVR4/SVID3 level of the shell. 

The Bourne shell is suitable for

    * script portability testing
    * processing of legacy scripts
    * general script processing
    * interactive use

Note that this SlackBuild installs the shell as /usr/bin/hsh rather than
/usr/5bin/sh.
