hexec (hook into exec calls)

hexec can be used to hook into exec system calls. It evaluates a user
defined expression against all hooked exec calls. This expression can
contain simple path checks (e.g. -path "*/name") and even complex bash
scripts.

As an example: hexec -name ls -exec echo {} \; bash

This will run a shell, but any time you try to run "ls", you'll run
"echo" instead. The syntax is similar to "find"; see the man page for
details.
