HPLIP Plugin (Binary plugin for HP devices)

Some HP printers require proprietary software technologies to allow
full access to printer features and performance.

This plug-in is required by CUPS and HPLIP software for some laserjet
printers.

HPLIP Plugin is distributed under EULA license and this script accepts
the license for you. Do not use if you don't agree with the conditions.

To check the proper installation, use the "hp-diagnose_plugin" command.
