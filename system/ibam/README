IBAM (Intelligent BAttery Monitor)

IBAM is an advanced battery monitor for laptops, which uses
statistical and adaptive linear methods to provide accurate
estimations of minutes of battery left or of the time needed
until full recharge. This software relies on either APM, ACPI,
SYSFS or PMU kernel support to access the battery status.
