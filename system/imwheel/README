IMWheel is a universal mouse wheel and mouse stick translator for X
Windows using either a special version of gpm and its /dev/gpmwheel FIFO
or the support for a ZAxis on the mouse built into X.  Utilizing the
input from gpm or X Windows, imwheel translates mouse wheel and mouse
stick actions into keyboard events using the XTest extension to X.  Use
xdpyinfo for information on the supported extensions in your X server.

This build script has a patch that disables the configurator appearing
when you mouse up and down on the root window.  I did this because it
stopped the ability for workspace changing in fluxbox and other WMs, and
it would also pop up at the most annoying times ;)  However, the
configurator window can still be found with the "-c" switch.

If you do NOT wish to apply this patch, run the script with PATCH=no:

PATCH=no ./imwheel.SlackBuild
