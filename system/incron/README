This program is an "inotify cron" system. It consists of
a daemon and a table manipulator. You can use it a similar way
as the regular cron. The difference is that the inotify cron
handles filesystem events rather than time periods.

To start incrond automatically on system start, make sure that
/etc/rc.d/rc.incrond is executable and put the following line to your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.incrond ] && /etc/rc.d/rc.incrond start

To stop incrond on system shutdown, add this line to your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

  [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.incrond ] && /etc/rc.d/rc.incrond stop
