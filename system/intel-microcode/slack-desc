# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

intel-microcode:
intel-microcode: CPU microcode is a mechanism to correct certain errata in existing
intel-microcode: systems. The normal preferred method to apply microcode updates is
intel-microcode: using the system BIOS, but for a subset of Intel processors this
intel-microcode: can be done at runtime using the operating system. This package
intel-microcode: contains those processors that support OS loading of microcode
intel-microcode: updates.
