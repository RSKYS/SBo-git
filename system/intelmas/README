intelmas (Intel Memory And Storage Tool)

The intelmas is a proprietary command-line tool to manage Intel SSDs and
Optane memory devices. It provides firmware update capability as well as
reading and setting many configuration settings.

The intelmas unifies functionality of several Intel programs including
the isdct (Intel SSD Data Center Tool), which was previously available
on SBo. The intelmas is a drop-in replacement for the isdct.

To work with SATA drives intelmas requires the sg kernel module. To have
this module loaded on boot, please uncomment the corresponding line in
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local
