# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jpnevulator: What once started as a Jackpot Navigator emulator (hence the
jpnevulator: strange name) is now a nice serial sniffer and you can use it
jpnevulator: to send data on a serial line too. It's sort of like a very
jpnevulator: simple terminal emulator, like picocom. But jpnevulator uses
jpnevulator: hexadecimal byte values to display and send along the line.
jpnevulator:
jpnevulator: Very handy indeed if you are working a lot with serial
jpnevulator: protocols.
