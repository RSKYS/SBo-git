Kcollectd (Qt4-based frontend for collectd)

Kcollectd is a small applications that allows to view rrd datacollections
that have been created by collectd.

It is quite limited as it only displays one datasource at a time, but
allows to zoom and scroll around. It also has a status-monitor mode,
where it automatic updates every 10 seconds.
