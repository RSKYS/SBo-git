\fBxkegs\fP [\-skip \fInum\fP] [\-audio [\fI0|1\fP] [\-arate \fInum\fP] [\-dhr140] [\-15] [\-16] [\-24] [\-display \fIxdisplay\fP] [\-noshm]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
KEGS (Kent\(aqs Emulated GS) is an Apple IIgs emulator for Mac OS X,
Linux, and Win32. The Apple IIgs was the most powerful computer in the
Apple II line. It first was sold in 1986. An Apple IIgs has the
capability to run almost all Apple II, Apple IIe, and Apple IIc
programs.
.sp
xkegs is the KEGS binary, compiled for Linux and X\-Window support.
.sp
This manual page only documents the command\-line options
and key mappings. For the full documentation, see
/usr/doc/kegs\-1.29/README.kegs.txt (and the other files in the
same directory).
.sp
Note: There is no way to specify disk or ROM images on the command
line. Use the configuration menu (F4) from within the emulator to select images.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-skip \fInum\fP
KEGS will "skip" that many screen redraws between refreshes.
\-skip 0 will do 60 frames per second, \-skip 1 will do 30 fps,
\-skip 5 will do 10 fps.
.TP
.B \-audio \fI0|1\fP
Forces audio [off/on]. By default, audio is on unless the X
display is a remote machine or shared memory is off. This
switch can override the default. \-audio 0 causes KEGS to not
fork the background audio process, but Ensoniq emulation is
still 100% accurate, just the sound is not sent to the workstation
speaker.
.TP
.B \-arate \fInum\fP
Forces audio sample rate to [num]. 44100 and 48000 are usual,
you can try 22050 to reduce KEGS\(aqs overhead. On a reasonably
fast machine (>250MHz or so), you shouldn\(aqt need to mess with
this.
.TP
.B \fB\-dhr140\fP
Will use the old Double\-hires color algorithm that results in
exactly 140 colors across the screen, as opposed to the blending
being done by default.
.TP
.B \-15
KEGS will only look for a 15\-bit X\-Window display.
.TP
.B \-16
KEGS will only look for a 16\-bit X\-Window display (not tested, probably
will get red colors wrong).
.TP
.B \-24
KEGS will only look for a 24\-bit X\-Window display.
.TP
.B \-display \fIxdisplay\fP
Same as setting the environment variable DISPLAY. Sends X display to [xdisplay]
.TP
.B \fB\-noshm\fP
KEGS will not try to used shared memory for the X graphics
display. This will make KEGS much slower on graphics\-intensive
tasks, by as much as a factor of 10! By default, \-noshm causes
an effective \-skip of 3 which is 15 fps. You can override this
default by specifying a \-skip explicitly.

.UNINDENT
.SH FILES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B ~/.config.kegs
The KEGS configuration file. This can be directly edited if necessary,
but normally is changed by using the configuration menu
(F4) from within KEGS. To return to the default configuration,
you may remove this file.
.TP
.B /usr/share/kegs/rom03 (or /usr/share/kegs/rom01)
The Apple IIgs BIOS ROM image. If KEGS can\(aqt find this ROM, it
will start up with a black display, full of white @ characters.
Press F4 for the config menu and use the UI to select the correct
ROM image file.
.sp
For reference, the ROM image details are:

Other versions of the IIgs ROMs may exist (this author isn\(aqt aware of
any), but these two images are known to work.
.TP
.B /usr/bin/xkegs
Wrapper script. xkegs will fail to run if it can\(aqt find its config
file, so this script creates one in the user\(aqs home directory
if necessary, then runs the real xkegs binary.
.TP
.B /usr/libexec/xkegs
Actual xkegs binary. Shouldn\(aqt be run directly (use the wrapper
instead).
.TP
.B /usr/share/kegs/config.kegs.default
Copied to \fB~/.config.kegs\fP by the wrapper script, if \fB~/.config.kegs\fP
doesn\(aqt already exist. Can be used to set system\-wide
defaults (such as the path to the ROM image).
