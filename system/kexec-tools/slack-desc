# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kexec-tools: kexec-tools (Soft-Reboot and Crash-Dump Analysis for Linux and Xen)
kexec-tools:
kexec-tools: kexec is a system call that enables you to load and booy into
kexec-tools: another kernel from the currently running kernel. kexec performs
kexec-tools: the function of the boot loader from within the kernel. The
kexec-tools: Primary difference between a standard system boot and a kexec boot
kexec-tools: is that the hardware initialization normally performed by the BIOS
kexec-tools: or firmware is not performed during a kexec boot. This has the
kexec-tools: the effect of reducing the time required for a reboot.
kexec-tools: Make sure you have selected CONFIG_KEXEC=y when configuring the
kexec-tools: kernel. The CONFIG_KEXEC option enables the kexec system call.
