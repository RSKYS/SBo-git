kitty-bin (fast, featureful, GPU-based terminal emulator)

kitty is a terminal emulator for X11 and Wayland [1], which offloads
the rendering to the GPU [2] and supports modern terminal features. It
also supports tiling multiple terminal windows without using an extra
program like screen or tmux.

This conflicts with system/kitty. Do not install kitty-bin and kitty
on the same system.

This build packages the official kitty binaries for Linux. If you'd
rather build from source, you can install system/kitty instead, but be
aware that kitty-bin will usually be a newer version of kitty.

[1] For Wayland support, it may be necessary to add the following 
    line to ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf:
    linux_display_server wayland

[2] Requires hardware-accelerated OpenGL support.

See README.aarch64 if you're using 64-bit ARM.
