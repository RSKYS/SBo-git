kitty (fast, featureful, GPU-based terminal emulator)

kitty is a terminal emulator for X11 and Wayland [1], which offloads
the rendering to the GPU [2] and supports modern terminal features. It
also supports tiling multiple terminal windows without using an extra
program like screen or tmux.

[1] For Wayland support, it may be necessary to add the following 
    line to ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf:
    linux_display_server wayland

[2] Requires hardware-accelerated OpenGL support.
