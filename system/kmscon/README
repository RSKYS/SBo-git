kmscon (KMS/DRM based System Console)

kmscon is a system console for linux. It does not depend on any
graphics-server on your system (like X.org), but instead provides a raw
console layer that can be used independently. It can replace the linux
kernel console entirely but was designed to work well side-by-side,
too. Even though initially targeted at providing internationalization
to the system-console, it has grown into a fully modularized console
layer including features like multi-head support, internationalized
font rendering, XKB-compatible keyboard handling, hardware-accelerated
graphics access and more.
