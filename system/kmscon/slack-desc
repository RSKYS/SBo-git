# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kmscon: kmscon (KMS/DRM based System Console)
kmscon:
kmscon: kmscon is a system console for linux. It does not depend on any
kmscon: graphics-server on your system (like X.org), but instead provides
kmscon: a raw console layer that can be used independently. It can replace
kmscon: the linux kernel console entirely but was designed to work well
kmscon: side-by-side, too. Even though initially targeted at providing
kmscon: internationalization to the system-console, it has grown into a fully
kmscon: modularized console layer including features like multi-head support,
kmscon: internationalized font rendering, XKB-compatible keyboard handling,
kmscon: hardware-accelerated graphics access and more.
