lbrate extracts/decompresses files from CP/M LBR format. (It can also
list and test such archives.) It does this in an 'unzip'-like manner,
mostly hiding the details of individually compressed and renamed 
files, and transparently deals with required decompression/renaming.
lbrate supports all three CP/M compression schemes (Q, Z, Y) and 
treats them as single entry LBR archives.
