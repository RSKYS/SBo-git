lddsafe (safe replacement for ldd)

lddsafe prints shared library dependencies for executables and shared
libraries. However, it uses objdump instead of loading the program,
hence avoiding the security problems of ldd. lddsafe also includes
nonrecursive mode (-n option), which lists direct dependencies only.
