lf (as in "list files") is a terminal file manager written in Go with
a heavy inspiration from ranger file manager.

Features:

•Cross-platform (Linux, MacOS, BSDs, Windows)
•Single binary without any runtime dependencies
•Fast startup and low memory footprint due to native code and static
 binaries
•Asynchronous IO operations to avoid UI locking
•Server/client architecture and remote commands to manage multiple
 instances
•Extendable and configurable with shell commands
•Customizable keybindings (vi and readline defaults)
•A reasonable set of other features

Usage:

After the installation lf command should start the application in the
current directory.
Run lf -help to see command line options.
Run lf -doc
