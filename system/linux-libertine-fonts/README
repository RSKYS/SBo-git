Serif (Libertine) and Sans Serif (Biolinum) fonts with large Unicode
coverage.

The Libertine Open Fonts project aims at creating a free alternative
to the standard W*ndows Font (T*mes).

The font files are available as TTF (TrueType) and OTF (OpenType)
fonts. The TTF-Family is called
"Linux Libertine" and "Linux Biolinum"
and the OTF
"LinuxLibertine O" and "Linux Biolinum O".
