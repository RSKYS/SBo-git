# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lnav:
lnav: An enhanced log file viewer that takes advantage of any semantic
lnav: information that can be gleaned from the files being viewed, such as
lnav: timestamps and log levels. Using this extra semantic information,
lnav: lnav can do things like interleaving messages from different files,
lnav: generate histograms of messages over time, and providing hotkeys for
lnav: navigating through the file. It is hoped that these features will
lnav: allow the user to quickly and efficiently zero in on problems.
