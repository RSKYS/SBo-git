# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

logkeys: logkeys (a GNU/Linux keylogger that works!)
logkeys:
logkeys: logkeys is a linux keylogger. It is no more advanced than other
logkeys: available linux keyloggers, notably lkl and uberkey, but is a bit
logkeys: newer, more up to date, it doesn't unreliably repeat keys and it
logkeys: shouldn't crash your X. All in all, it just seems to work. It relies
logkeys: on event interface of the Linux input subsystem. Once completely set,
logkeys: it logs all common character and function keys, while also being
logkeys: fully aware of Shift and AltGr key modifiers.
