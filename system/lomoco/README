lomoco (Logitech Mouse Control for Linux)

lomoco can configure vendor-specific options on Logitech USB mice (or
dual-personality mice plugged into the USB port). A number of recent
devices are supported. The program is mostly useful in setting the
resolution to 800 cpi or higher on mice that boot at 400 cpi (such as
the MX500, MX510, MX1000 etc.), and disabling SmartScroll or Cruise
Control for those who would rather use the two extra buttons as
ordinary mouse buttons.
