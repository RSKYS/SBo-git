# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lomoco: lomoco can configure vendor-specific options on Logitech USB mice (or
lomoco: dual-personality mice plugged into the USB port). A number of recent
lomoco: devices are supported. The program is mostly useful in setting the
lomoco: resolution to 800 cpi or higher on mice that boot at 400 cpi (such as
lomoco: the MX500, MX510, MX1000 etc.), and disabling SmartScroll or Cruise
lomoco: Control for those who would rather use the two extra buttons as
lomoco: ordinary mouse buttons.
