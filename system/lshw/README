lshw (Hardware Lister) is a small tool to provide detailed information
on the hardware configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory
configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version
and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc. on DMI-capable x86 or
EFI (IA-64) systems and on some PowerPC machines (PowerMac G4 is known
to work).

Information can be output in plain text, XML, or HTML.

It currently supports DMI (x86 and EFI only), OpenFirmware device tree
(PowerPC only), PCI/AGP, ISA PnP (x86), CPUID (x86), IDE/ATA/ATAPI,
PCMCIA (only tested on x86), USB, and SCSI.

On x86, lshw needs to be run as root to be able to access DMI
information from the BIOS. Running lshw as a non-root user usually gives
much less detailed information.

There several build options available for the SlackBuild:

  GUI=no           Disable GTK GUI support (default: yes)
  ZLIB=yes         Enable zlib support (default: no)
  SQLITE=yes       Enable sqlite support (default: no)

where one or more build options are passed to the SlackBuild. For
example, to disable GUI and enable zlib support use:

  GUI=no ZLIB=yes ./lshw.SlackBuild
