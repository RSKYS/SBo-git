lv (pager, grep, and iconv replacement)

lv is a powerful file viewer like less. lv can decode and encode
multilingual streams in many encodings, including ISO-8859, ISO-2022,
EUC, SJIS, Big5, HZ, and Unicode. It recognizes multi-byte patterns
in regular expressions, and can be run as "lgrep" to act as a grep
replacement. In addition, lv can recognize ANSI escape sequences for
text decoration (making it suitable for use as MANPAGER).

lv can also be used as a replacement for iconv(1), by redirecting
its standard output and using the -I and -O options to set the input
and output encodings. Although it doesn't support all the features of
iconv, lv will autodetect the input encoding (which iconv won't).

lv also has one (possibly) unique feature: It can autodetect and
convert or display multiple character encodings *within the same
document*.
