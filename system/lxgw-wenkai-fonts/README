This package contains a repackage of the LXGW WenKai font family.
The font is a Japanese textbook-style font that combines features of
Fangsong and Kai style scripts, modified by LXGW to include common
Chinese characters. This provides all weights (Bold, Regular, Light)
and their monospace variants.

For glyphs with additional modifications to comply with GB (China)
standards, please refer to the fonts-lxgw-wenkai-gb package; for
inherited-glyph lovers, please refer to the fonts-lxgw-wenkai-tc
package.
