This package contains a repackage of the LXGW WenKai GB font family.
The font is a Japanese textbook-style font that combines features of
Fangsong and Kai style scripts, modified by LXGW to include common
Chinese characters, and adhere to GB standards. This provides all
weights (Bold, Regular, Light) and their monospace variants.

For the original glyphs, please refer to the fonts-lxgw-wenkai package;
for inherited-glyph lovers, please refer to the fonts-lxgw-wenkai-tc
package.
