This package contains a repackage of the LXGW WenKai TC font family.
The font is a textbook-style font that combines characteristics of
Fangsong and Kai style scripts, modified by LXGW to include common
Chinese characters and adhere to the "inherited glyphs" standard.
This provides all weights (Bold, Regular, Light) and their monospace
variants.

For the original glyphs, please refer to the fonts-lxgw-wenkai package;
for glyphs with additional modifications to comply with GB (China)
standards, please refer to the fonts-lxgw-wenkai-gb package.
