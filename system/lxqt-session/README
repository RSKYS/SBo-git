lxqt-session is the session manager for LXQt. It contains tools for
handling logins and ending sessions (e.x. logout, shutdown, reboot,
hibernate).

lxqt-session is responsible for starting LXQt upon login.

A window manager is required for LXQt.
Openbox is the main window manager; however, other window managers
may be used (e.x. xfwm4, kwin, i3).
