lzop (LZO compressor/decompressor)

lzop is an LZO compressor. It uses the LZO data compression library for
compression services, and its main advantages over gzip are much higher
compression and decompression speed (at the cost of some compression
ratio).

lzop is the fastest (de)compressor around.
