makepp (drop-in replacement for GNU make, with extra features)

Makepp, a build program which has a number of features that allow for
reliable builds and simpler build files, is a drop-in replacement for
GNU make. It supports almost all of the syntax that GNU make supports,
and can be used with makefiles produced by utilities such as automake.

Some of makepp's extra features include:

- Extended Makefile syntax, including embedded perl code.
- Logging and extra diagnostics, which allows makepp to act as "lint"
  for Makefiles.
- Can create a visual graph of the dependencies in a Makefile, using
  graphviz for rendering.
