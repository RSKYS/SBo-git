man-pages-ru (Russian system documentation)

Russian translation for system man pages. This requires a terminal
that can handle UTF-8 (such as konsole, xfce4-terminal, or
rxvt-unicode), and a UTF-8 locale such as LANG=ru_RU.UTF-8. You'll
also need a font that displays Cyrillic glyphs (should be included
with Slackware already).

Sadly, this isn't a complete set of man pages. For instance, there are
no man pages included for coreutils.
