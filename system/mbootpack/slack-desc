# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mbootpack: mbootpack (Multiboot kernel and modules)
mbootpack:
mbootpack: This is a tool that takes a multiboot kernel and modules (e.g. a Xen
mbootpack: VMM, linux kernel and initrd), and packages them up as a single file
mbootpack: that looks like a bzImage linux kernel. The aim is to allow you to
mbootpack: boot multiboot kernels (in particular, Xen) using bootloaders that
mbootpack: don't support multiboot (i.e. pretty much anything except GRUB and
mbootpack: SYSLINUX). This is, as you might expect, pretty grim stuff, involving
mbootpack: lots of lovely 16-bit real-mode code.
