Memkind helps to fully utilize various kinds of
memory available in the system,including DRAM,NVDIMM
and HBM, mostly by adding one additional argument
destination kind of memory to standard malloc calls.

It also offers a transparent mode that allows memory
tiering without any modification to the existing app, 
memory kinds based on file-backed memory on specified 
device or area supplied by the user, and much more.

hwloc >=2.3.0 is an optional dependency.
