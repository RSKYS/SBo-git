memory-editor (med) is a memory editor for Linux with a GUI.

There was a memory editor in Windows, that was Game Master. But it
was not a freeware. And there is a freeware memory editor, it is
ArtMoney. But it is also for Windows only. In Linux, there is only
one memory editor, scanmem with GameConqueror as the GUI. However,
it does not fulfil my needs. Thus, I decided to create one which can
fit my needs.
