Memtest86+ is thorough, stand alone memory test for Intel/AMD x86
architecture systems. BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check
and often miss failures that are detected by Memtest86+.

This package installs a bootable image to /boot/memtest86+.bin
which is similar to the kernel images in the same directory.


LILO users:  Append this to your /etc/lilo.conf:

  image = /boot/memtest86+.bin
    label = memtest86+

Then run `/sbin/lilo` to update the boot loader.
Don't forget to re-run `/sbin/lilo` if you upgrade this package.


ELILO users:  Append this to your /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/elilo.conf:

  image = memtest86+.bin
    label = memtest86+

Next, copy memtest86+.bin alongside ELILO in your ESP partition:
`cp /boot/memtest86+.bin /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/memtest86+.bin`
(Alternatively, use the .efi file instead of the .bin file; both should
work identically.  Just ensure that "image" refers to an existing file.)

When ELILO starts, press tab to show the available options.  Increase
the delay parameter in elilo.conf if necessary to give yourself enough
time to make a selection.


GRUB Legacy users:  Append something like this to your
/boot/grub/menu.lst:

  title memtest86+
      kernel (hd0,0)/boot/memtest86+.bin


GRUB 2 users:  Auto-detected by the /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86+ script.
Run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` to update the boot menu.


rEFInd users:  Auto-detected, no additional steps required.
You may wish to copy /boot/memtest86+-$EFIARCH-$VERSION.efi
to /boot/efi/EFI/tools/memtest86.efi so that it will appear on the tools
line as a memory tester tool.  If at this point it appears on both
lines, edit the "dont_scan_files" setting in your refind.conf to hide
the extra entries, or just remove this package.


It is possible to build an IA32 EFI image on Slackware64, if you have a
need for it, using `ARCH=i586 ./memtest86+.SlackBuild`.  Compilation
will fail due to missing /usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h from glibc.  Copy
that file from stubs-64.h in the same directory (or create a symlink),
and you may delete your copy/symlink after you have created the package.

See /usr/doc/memtest86+-$VERSION/README.md for more info.
