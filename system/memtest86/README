Memtest86 is a thorough, stand-alone memory test for x86 architecture
computers. BIOS based memory tests are a quick, cursory check and
often miss many of the failures that are detected by Memtest86.

This package installs a bootable image to /boot/memtest86.bin
which is similar to the kernel images in the same directory.


LILO users:  Append this to your /etc/lilo.conf:

  image = /boot/memtest86.bin
    label = memtest86

Then run `/sbin/lilo` to update the boot loader.
Don't forget to re-run `/sbin/lilo` if you upgrade this package.


GRUB Legacy users:  Append something like this to your
/boot/grub/menu.lst:

  title memtest86
      kernel (hd0,0)/boot/memtest86.bin


GRUB 2 users:  Auto-detected by the /etc/grub.d/20_memtest86 script.
Run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg` to update the boot menu.


See /usr/doc/memtest86-$VERSION/README for more info.
