# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

memtester: memtester (memory test utility)
memtester:
memtester: memtester is a userspace utility for testing the memory subsystem
memtester: for faults. Unlike memtest86, it runs as a process on a running
memtester: Linux system, meaning it can't test all of memory the way memtest86
memtester: is able to... but you don't have to reboot to use it.
