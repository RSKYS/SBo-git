Firmware loaders for M-Audio/Midiman USB MIDI and Audio devices

These package allows you to use some of M-Audio's USB MIDI and Audio 
interfaces with Linux.  These devices require a firmware download 
before a driver (e.g. ALSA's snd-usb-audio) can access them. 

Supported devices include MidiSport 1x1, MidiSport 2x2, MidiSport 4x4, 
MidiSport 8x8, KeyStation (old models: 49, 61), Oxygen, Radium49,
Radium61, and Uno.
