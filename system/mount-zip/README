mount-zip (FUSE file system for zip archives)

mount-zip mounts a ZIP archive as a read-only FUSE file system, which
can then be explored and read by any application.

mount-zip aspires to be an excellent ZIP mounter. It starts quickly,
uses little memory, decodes encrypted files, and provides on-the-go
decompression and caching for maximum efficiency.
