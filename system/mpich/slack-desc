# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mpich: mpich (High-Performance Portable MPI)
mpich:
mpich: MPICH is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
mpich: Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3).
mpich: The goals of MPICH are: to provide an MPI implementation that
mpich: efficiently supports different computation and communication
mpich: platforms including commodity clusters, high-speed networks and
mpich: proprietary high-end computing systems, and to enable cutting-edge
mpich: research in MPI through an easy-to-extend modular framework for other
mpich: derived implementations.
