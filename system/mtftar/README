mtftar is a tool for translating a MTF stream to a TAR stream.
MTF is a format commonly found on Microsoft systems as it's
what is generated by the NTBACKUP.EXE tool that ships with
all modern versions of Windows.

The $VERSION of this package has been derived from the 
changelog document contained in the source tarball because
the source tarball is not distributed with a version number
or a date.
