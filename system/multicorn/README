Multicorn is a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension meant to make Foreign Data
Wrapper development easy, by allowing the programmer to use the Python
programming language.

- Multicorn allows you to access any data source in your PostgreSQL
  database.
- You can leverage the full power of SQL to query your data sources.
- Every tool you use for SQL can be reused with those datasources (think
  about an ORM, BI tool...).
