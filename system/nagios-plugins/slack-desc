# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nagios-plugins:
nagios-plugins: Unlike many other monitoring tools, Nagios does not include any
nagios-plugins: internal mechanisms for checking the status of hosts and services on
nagios-plugins: your network. Instead, Nagios relies on external programs (called
nagios-plugins: plugins) to do all the dirty work. Plugins are compiled executables or
nagios-plugins: scripts (Perl scripts, shell scripts, etc.) that can be run from a
nagios-plugins: command line to check the status or a host or service.
