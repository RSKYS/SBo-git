Nkf is a yet another kanji code converter among networks, hosts and
terminals. It converts input kanji code to designated kanji code
such as ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32.

One of the most unique faculty of nkf is the guess of the input
kanji encodings. It currently recognizes ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS,
EUC-JP, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. So users needn't set the input
kanji code explicitly.

By default, X0201 kana is converted into X0208 kana.
For X0201 kana, SO/SI, SSO and ESC-(-I methods are supported.

For automatic code detection, nkf assumes no X0201 kana in
Shift_JIS. To accept X0201 in Shift_JIS, use -X, -x or -S.
