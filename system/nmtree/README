nmtree is a utility for mapping and checking directory hierarchies.
This version is ported from NetBSD.

The binary and manpages will install as nmtree instead of the default
mtree because libarchive provides an mtree(5) manpage.
Regardless, the nmtree manpages will still refer to the program as
mtree.
