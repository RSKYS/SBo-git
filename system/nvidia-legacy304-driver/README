This is the proprietary binary video driver from NVidia for the X.Org
X-server. This package does not include the kernel-module - it is a part
of the nvidia-kernel package at SlackBuilds.org.

Since this nvidia-driver conflicts with some files of xorg, it's a bit
complex to install/uninstall the driver. However, installation of the
nvidia-driver package itself backs up the conflicting files and puts
the nvidia-specific files into place.

Included is a script called nvidia-switch, which is used to switch from
the xorg driver to the nvidia driver, but it will not edit xorg.conf for
you; you have to do that manually. The nvidia-switch script is installed
to /usr/sbin.

Usage of nvidia-switch:
  nvidia-switch --install  <--> install the nvidia files and save the
                                stock xorg files.
  nvidia-switch --remove   <--> remove the nvidia files and symlinks and
                                restore the stock xorg files.

You do NOT have to run nvidia-switch after installing the package.

Note: x86_64 COMPAT32 enviroment is not supported.

Before uninstalling or upgrading this package, it is important that
you execute 'nvidia-switch --remove', which will switch back to the
stock xorg files and remove all links created by nvidia-switch during
installation. If you forget to do this, you'll have to do the switch
manually, or xorg won't work on next startup.

Here are the affected files:
  /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2
  /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/{libglx.so libglx.la}

or, for Slackware64,

  /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1.2
  /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/extensions/{libglx.so libglx.la}

Simply remove the dead nvidia symlinks and rename the saved '-xorg'
appended files.

Requires:  nvidia-kernel,libvdpau
