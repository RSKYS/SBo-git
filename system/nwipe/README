nwipe is a fork of the dwipe command originally used by Darik's Boot
and Nuke (DBAN). nwipe was created out of a need to run the DBAN dwipe
command outside of DBAN, in order to allow its use with any host
distribution, thus giving better hardware support.

nwipe is a program that will securely erase the entire contents of
disks. It can wipe a single drive or multiple disks simultaneously.
It can operate as both a command line tool without a GUI or with a
ncurses GUI.

The user can select from a variety of recognised secure erase methods:

- Fill With Zeros
- Fill With Ones
- RCMP TSSIT OPS-II
- DoD Short
- DoD 5220.22M
- Gutmann Wipe
- PRNG Stream
- HMG IS5 enhanced
