oldschool-pc-fonts (remakes of PC text mode fonts)

The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack brings you pixel-perfect
remakes of various type styles from text-mode era PCs - in modern,
multi-platform, Unicode-compatible TrueType (and OpenType Bitmap)
form, and/or as Linux .psfu console fonts.

By default, the package will include TrueType and OTB (OpenType
Bitmap) fonts. To also include console fonts (PSFU), install
graphics/psftools before running this script. If you only want console
fonts, set TTF=no in the script's environment. See README_console.txt
for more information.
