OneRNG (entropy generator)

The OneRNG entropy generator is a USB dongle that creates a stream of
data suitable for feeding to your kernel's entropy service. The device
does not need a special kernel driver.

This package installs a udev script that starts the rngd entropy
daemon when a OneRNG is plugged in.
