# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

openct: openct (Middleware framework for smart card terminals)
openct:
openct: It implements drivers for several smart card readers.  It comes as
openct: driver in ifdhandler format for PC/SC-Lite, as CT-API driver, or
openct: as a small and lean middleware, so applications can use it with
openct: minimal overhead.  OpenCT also has a primitive mechanism to export
openct: smart card readers to remote machines via TCP/IP.
