# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

opensc: opensc (SmartCard utilities/libraries for PKCS#11/15 compatible cards)
opensc:
opensc: It provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
opensc: cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic
opensc: operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such
opensc: as mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
opensc: implements the PKCS#11 API so applications supporting this API such
opensc: as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird can use it. OpenSC implements
opensc: the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with every software
opensc: that does so, too.
