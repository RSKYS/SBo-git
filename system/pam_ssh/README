The pam_ssh module provides single sign-on behavior for ssh.
On login, the user types an ssh private key passphrase in place of,
or in addition to the password. In the pam session phase, an
ssh-agent process is started and keys are added. For the entire
session, the user can ssh to other hosts that accept key
authentication without typing any passwords.
