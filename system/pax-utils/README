pax-utils (security audit tools for ELF binaries)

pax-utils is a small set of utilities for peforming Q/A (mostly
security) checks on systems (most notably, scanelf). It is focused on
the ELF format, but does include a Mach-O helper too for OS X systems.

You don't need PaX to use the pax-utils. In fact, the only thing they
really have in common is that pax-utils was initially written to aid
in deploying PaX systems.
