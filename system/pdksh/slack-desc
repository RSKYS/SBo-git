# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pdksh:
pdksh: PD-ksh is a clone of the AT&T; Korn shell. At the moment, it has most
pdksh: of the ksh88 features, not much of the ksh93 features, and a number of
pdksh: its own features. pdksh was initially created by Eric Gisin using
pdksh: Charles Forsyth's public domain V7 shell as a base as well as parts of
pdksh: the BRL shell.
