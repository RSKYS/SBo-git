pgBadger is a fast PostgreSQL log analyzer written in Perl.  It uses
JavaScript library to draw graphs with zooming and other features.
pgBadger is able to autodetect log file format (syslog, stderr or
csvlog).  It is designed to parse huge log files as well as gzip
compressed files.

perl-Text-CSV_XS and perl-JSON-XS are optional dependencies.
