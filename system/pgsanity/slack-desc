# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pgsanity: pgsanity (SQL syntax checker for PostgreSQL)
pgsanity:
pgsanity: PgSanity checks the syntax of PostgreSQL SQL files.  It does this by
pgsanity: leveraging the ecpg command which is traditionally used for preparing
pgsanity: C files with embedded SQL for compilation.  However, as part of that
pgsanity: preparation, ecpg checks the embedded SQL statements for syntax errors
pgsanity: using the exact same parser that is in PostgreSQL.
