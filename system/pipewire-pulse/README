Take over audio/media system totally by Pipewire this time!

##Important Notes
Blacklist following packages to prevent any reinstall for this package:

daemon
pulseaudio

Or, just don't accept any .NEW configs from pulse while you upgrade by
slackpkg.

In case you want to switch back to pulse remove this package,
then you need to execute commands of these two section:

Pulseaudio needs to take in charge again
    $ cd /etc/xdg/autostart # Switch to directory
    $ mv .pulseaudio.desktop.old pulseaudio.desktop

We do exact same to client.conf
    $ cd /etc/pulse # Switch to directory
    $ mv .client.conf.old client.conf
