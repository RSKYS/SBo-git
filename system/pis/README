Slackware Post-Install Scripts (PIS)

'Let the Slackers be a little bit lazy. ;)'

Slackware Post-Installation Scripts (PIS) are a set of shell scripts
for automating the most tedious Slackware version 15.0 post-
installation configuration tasks. With PIS you can: set system locale
(language, country and character encoding); configure login mode (GUI
or CLI); add new users and set the 'sudo' admin support; set 'Huge'
and 'Generic' kernels to boot manager; configure different package
managers; and more!

Important Notes
===============

To perform the system settings, PIS scripts will modify some
important system files by using command line tools, such as the stream
editor 'sed', so bypassing the use of the conventional tools.

So, if you want to feel more secure in using the PIS scripts, it would
be interesting to back up the following files, in case you need to
restore manually the respective settings:

 * To set the system locale (language and country):
   /etc/profile.d/lang.sh
   /etc/profile.d/lang.csh

 * To set the command line keymap (keyboard character encoding):
   /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap
  
 * To select the login mode (GUI or CLI):
   /etc/inittab

 * To add different kernels types/versions to boot manager Elilo:
   /boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/elilo.conf
 
 * To enable the administrative group 'wheel':
   /etc/sudoers
 
 * To set the default desktop/window manager for the X environment:
   /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

 * To set the main mirror of the slackpkg package manager:
   /etc/slackpkg/mirrors
