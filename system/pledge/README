pledge (OpenBSD command and syscall implementation for Linux)

pledge is a port of OpenBSD's syscall to Linux by Justine Tunney.
This script builds a shared library (to be injected via LD_PRELOAD)
and a command line utility to restrict program execution privileges
and limit parameters such as maximum niceness, cpu time, virtual
memory, file descriptors, child processes, and individual file sizes.

* pledge help is available via the -h option

    '_PLEDGE=4194303,0 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/pledge/sandbox.so ls'
