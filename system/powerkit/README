powerkit is an lightweight desktop independent full featured power
manager, originally created for Slackware for use with alternative
desktop environments and window managers, like Fluxbox, Blackbox, FVWM,
WindowMaker, Openbox, Lumina and others.

Hibernation/HybridSleep requires the kernel option
resume=<swap_partition/swap_file>. Backlight support requires proper
udev rules, see /usr/doc/powerkit-VERSION/90-backlight.rules. Read 'man
powerkit' and /usr/doc/powerkit-VERSION/README.md for more information.
