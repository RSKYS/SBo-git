PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language
built on .NET. PowerShell helps system administrators and power-users
rapidly automate tasks that manage operating systems (Linux, macOS, and
Windows) and processes.

After installing, you can start using PowerShell by typing "pwsh" in the
Terminal.
