# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

prelink: prelink (ELF prelinking utility)
prelink:
prelink: prelink is a program which modifies shared ELF libraries and
prelink: dynamically linked ELF binaries so that the time the dynamic
prelink: linker needs for their relocation at startup is significantly
prelink: decreased.  Also, due to fewer relocations, the run-time
prelink: memory consumption of libraries/binaries is decreased.
