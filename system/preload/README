Preload is an adaptive readahead daemon. It monitors applications 
that users run, and by analyzing this data, predicts what apps 
users might run, and fetches those binaries and their dependencies 
into memory for faster startup times.

Note that preload might occasionally interfere with some things;
at least mkinitrd can experience unexpected/broken behavior.
