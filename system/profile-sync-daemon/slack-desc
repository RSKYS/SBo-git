# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

profile-sync-daemon: profile-sync-daemon (Manage browser profiles in tmpfs)
profile-sync-daemon:
profile-sync-daemon: Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage
profile-sync-daemon: your browser's profile in tmpfs and to periodically sync it back to
profile-sync-daemon: your physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking
profile-sync-daemon: step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain back-up and
profile-sync-daemon: synchronization between the two. One of the major design goals of
profile-sync-daemon: psd is a completely transparent user experience.
