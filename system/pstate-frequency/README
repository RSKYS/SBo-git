pstate-frequency is able to adjust the Intel p-state driver
values for the minimum and maximum scaling frequencies and
the state of turbo boost.

You can enable optional feature by passing variables to
the script (ie. VAR=yes/no ./pstate-frequency.SlackBuild):

WITH_POWER_PLANS=yes|no (default=yes)
  Installs power plans in /etc/pstate-frequency.d/

  Power Plans are convenience shortcuts which essentially
  alias to calling pstate-frequency with various options.
  They are not necessary for operation, but are recommended.

WITH_BASH_COMPLETION=yes|no (default=no)
  Installs bash completion.

WITH_ZSH_COMPLETION=yes|no (default=no)
  Installs zsh completion.

WITH_UDEV_RULE=yes|no (default=no)
  Installs an udev rule for automatic frequency setting
  when the power source has changed.

  The udev rule is installed in directory specified by
  environment variable UDEV_RULE_DIR which, by default,
  is set to /lib/udev/rules.d. To install rule in, for
  instance, /etc/udev/rules.d, run the SlackBuild as
  below:

  WITH_UDEV_RULE=yes UDEV_RULE_DIR=/etc/udev/rules.d \
    ./pstate-frequency.SlackBuild

Optional Dependencies :

  * x86_energy_perf_policy
      This is used to set the CPU to normal performance
      policy upon suspend and resume. It is used to
      currently work around an assumed bug whereby on
      resume the system is set to performance policy on
      one core. It can help fix issues where upon resume
      of the system, the CPU runs at frequencies higher
      than that which is advertised to be available.
