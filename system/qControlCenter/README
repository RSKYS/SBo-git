qControlCenter (Easily customized Control Center)

qControlCenter has been written initially by Thierry Deseez.

qControlCenter lets you easily and quickly build a control center for
your distribution.

This can be useful if you don't like the control center of your
distribution, or if you distribution doesn't have any.

For ControlCenter to be of any use, you need to provide a base structure
containing .desktop files. After installation start qControlCenter,
click on the "i" button on the bottom right of the screen then on the
Instructions tab.

Or just read /usr/doc/qControlCenter-<version>/INSTRUCTIONS.txt.
