qingy (Framebuffer getty replacement)

qingy is a replacement of getty.
Written in C, it uses DirectFB to provide a fast, nice GUI
without the overhead of the X Window System.
It allows the user to log in and start the session of his choice
(text console, gnome, kde, wmaker, ...).

This SlackBuild compiles qingy without its screensaver feature because
it caused qingy to crash immediately upon startup and render the terminal
unusable.

To use qingy as a replacement for agetty, simply edit your /etc/inittab
and change the console login lines from:

  c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty --noclear 38400 tty1 linux
  c2:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty2 linux
  c3:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty3 linux
  c4:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty4 linux
  c5:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty5 linux
  c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux

to

  c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty1
  c2:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty2
  c3:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty3
  c4:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty4
  c5:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty5
  c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty6

It would be wise to leave agetty on at least one console until you're
sure that qingy is working correctly for you.
