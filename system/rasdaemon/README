Rasdaemon is a RAS (Reliability, Availability and Serviceability)
logging tool. It records memory errors, using the EDAC tracing
events. EDAC is a Linux kernel subsystem with handles detection of
ECC errors from memory controllers for most chipsets on i386 and
x86_64 architectures. EDAC drivers for other architectures like
arm also exists.

In order to use rasdaemon, you must have mounted a debugfs
filesystem.

  sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

You can add this to fstab:

  debugfs    /sys/kernel/debug      debugfs  defaults  0 0

To have rasdaemon start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.rasdaemon ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.rasdaemon start
  fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.rasdaemon ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.rasdaemon stop
  fi
