# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rdiff-backup:
rdiff-backup: rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a
rdiff-backup: network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source
rdiff-backup: directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special
rdiff-backup: subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover
rdiff-backup: files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best
rdiff-backup: features of a mirror and an incremental backup.
