# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rdup: rdup (utility to create a file list suitable for making backups)
rdup:
rdup: rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing things.
rdup: rdup itself does not backup anything. It only prints a list of files
rdup: that are changed, or all files in case of a null dump. It also handles
rdup: files that are removed, allowing for correct incremental backups.
