RFDump is a backend GPL tool to directly interoperate with any RFID
ISO-Reader to make the contents stored on RFID tags accessible. This
makes the following types of audits possible:

 * Test robustness of data-structures on the reader and the
   backend-application
 * Proof-of-concept manipulations of RFID tag contents
 * Clone / copy & paste User-Data stored on RFID tags
 * Audit tag-security features
