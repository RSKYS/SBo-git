The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework
dedicated to embedded devices.

It consists of various modules that aid penetration testing operations:

exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities
creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services
scanners - modules that check if a target is vulnerable to any exploit
