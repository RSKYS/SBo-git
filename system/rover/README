Rover is a file browser for the terminal.

The main goal is to provide a faster way to explore a file system from
the terminal, compared to what's possible by using cd, ls, etc. Rover
has vi-like key bindings for navigation and can open files in $PAGER
and $EDITOR. Basic file system operations are also implemented. Rover
is designed to be simple, fast and portable.

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
To customize rover, copy config.h from the source directory to the
the SlackBuild directory and edit it before running the SlackBuild.
