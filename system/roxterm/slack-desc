# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

roxterm: roxterm (VTE based Terminal Emulator)
roxterm:
roxterm: ROXTerm is a terminal emulator intended to provide similar features
roxterm: to gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library, but with a smaller
roxterm: footprint and quicker start-up time. It achieves this by not using
roxterm: the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet to provide the
roxterm: configuration GUI. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name
roxterm: implies, or in any other X environment.
