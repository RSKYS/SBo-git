Rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, among others, MySQL,
PostgreSQL, failover log destinations, syslog/tcp, fine grain output
format control, high precision timestamps, queued operations and the
ability to filter on any message part.  It is quite compatible with
stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in replacement.  Its advanced
features make it suitable for enterprise-class, encryption protected
syslog relay chains while at the same time being very easy to setup
for the novice user.

This package will conflict with sysklogd - in other words, you *need*
to remove sysklogd before installing rsyslog.

Before you can run rsyslog, please see README.SLACKWARE

You can enable a lot of optional (not-autodetected) features by
passing variables to the script (VAR=yes/no ./rsyslog.SlackBuild):
MYSQL=yes|no (default: no), requires mysql (available in Slackware)
PGSQL=yes|no (default: no), requires postgresql
RELP=yes|no (default: no), requires librelp
LIBDBI=yes|no (default: no), requires libdbi
GNUTLS=yes|no (default: no), requires gnutls
