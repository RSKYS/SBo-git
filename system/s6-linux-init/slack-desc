# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

s6-linux-init: s6-linux-init (a set of small tools to create an s6-based init system)
s6-linux-init:
s6-linux-init: s6-linux-init is a set of minimalistic tools used to create an
s6-linux-init: s6-based init system, including a /sbin/init binary, on a Linux
s6-linux-init: kernel. The resulting architecture follows the Unix philosophy (one
s6-linux-init: job -> one tool) as closely as possible, and is fully dedicated to
s6-linux-init: the s6 way of managing a system while still be fully compliant with
s6-linux-init: various empirical and historical specifications.
