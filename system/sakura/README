Sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and libvte. It has few
dependencies, so there's no need of a full GNOME desktop installed to
have a powerful terminal emulator. Sakura uses a GTK notebook to provide
tabbed terminals in one window and has a contextual menu for
configuration; it was designed without a menubar. No more or less.
