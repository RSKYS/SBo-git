# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sakura: sakura (a terminal emulator)
sakura:
sakura: Sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK and libvte. It has few
sakura: dependencies, so there's no need of a full GNOME desktop installed to
sakura: have a powerful terminal emulator. Sakura uses a GTK notebook to
sakura: provide tabbed terminals in one window and has a contextual menu for
sakura: configuration; it was designed without a menubar. No more or less.
