SaltStack or Salt is a Python-based open source configuration
management and remote execution engine.

This SlackBuild packages both the master and the minion.

Note: at this time, the pkg and service modules are not available
(unimplemented) in minions running Slackware.

Optional dependencies include:
  python-ldap
  GitPython
  libvirt
  pyOpenSSL
  CherryPy
  pymongo
  python-keyring
  MySQL-python
  redis-py
  python-gnupg

You must configure your master and your minions correctly before using
salt. For configuration details, please see:

  https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/index.html

To start the salt daemons automatically on your systems, you can add the
following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local, and then on each system enable
only the daemons you actually want, by making the rc scripts executable.

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-master ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-master start
  fi
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-minion ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-minion start
  fi
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-syndic ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-syndic start
  fi

On a master, you should enable the salt-master daemon:

  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-master

On a minion, you should enable the salt-minion daemon:

  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.salt-minion

You probably won't want to enable the salt-syndic daemon unless you have
configured a complex topology.
