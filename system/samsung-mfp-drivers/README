The samsung-mfp-drivers package contains a set of drivers for 
various Samsung printers and multifunction devices.  

Given that the maintainer of this build script only possesses
a Samsung ML-2955ND laser printer, and a confirmed test has 
been reported otherwise only with an M2825ND, results may vary 
with other devices (and fixes for those are certainly welcome).

After the package is installed, if you plan to use the scanner 
function of your device (assuming it's present), you'll need to
add a line containing "smfp-samsung" to /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
It's also possible that the line should read only "smfp" instead,
as that's what the terrible install script appends to the file,
but given how they name the config file, it's not immediately 
obvious how it would work.  Best wishes :-)
