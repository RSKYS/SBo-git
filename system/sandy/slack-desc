# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sandy: sandy is an ncurses text editor with an easy-to-read, hackable C

sandy: and not get in your way too much. It can somehow be controlled using
sandy: a named pipe that lives in /tmp and all preferences and keybindings
