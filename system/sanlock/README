The sanlock daemon manages leases for applications on hosts using shared
storage.

You must have a sanlock user to run this script:

  # groupadd -g 363 sanlock
  # useradd -u 363 -d /var/run/sanlock -s /bin/false -g sanlock sanlock

The disk group is also needed:

  # usermod -a -G disk sanlock

More information post-install can be found in README.SLACKWARE
