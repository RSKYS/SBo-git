sdltrs (Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P Emulator)

sdltrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Macintosh
OSX, Windows and Linux. It has been ported from the excellent X
Window Unix emulator xtrs. Instead of using the X-Window system for
graphics, it uses the portable SDL library.

This build uses SDL-1.2, which is an older library that performs
better on older and lower-spec machine. If your computer was made
in the last 10 years or so, you probably should be using the SDL-2.0
build, which is called sdl2trs. It's possible to install both sdltrs
and sdl2trs on the same system without conflict.

Optionally, sdltrs can be built without X11 support. Set X11=no in
the script's environment, to do this. This will make it possible
to run sdltrs directly on the console's framebuffer, or (probably)
under Wayland. However, the X libraries will still be required at
runtime because Slackware's SDL is linked with them.

Note: When you start up sdltrs for the first time, it attempts
to boot from floppy disk. If you didn't give either the "-disk0
/path/to/image.dsk" or "-nofloppy" options on the command line, it
will "hang" with a black screen, because it's trying to boot from a
nonexistent floppy disc. To recover from this:

- Hold down F10 (TRS-80 Reset) and press Escape (TRS-80 Break key) to
  skip the disk boot and enter the ROM BASIC.

- Press Alt+D to enter the emulator's disk menu, and from there,
  either select a bootable disk image for drive 0, or disable the
  floppy disk controller. Then press Shift-F10 to reboot the TRS-80.

See the man page and the documentation at
/usr/doc/sdltrs-$VERSION/html/index.html for further details.
