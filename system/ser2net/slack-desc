# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ser2net:
ser2net: This is ser2net, a program for allowing network connections to serial
ser2net: ports.  See the man page for information about using the program.
ser2net:
ser2net: Note that ser2net supports RFC 2217 (remote control of serial port
ser2net: parameters), but you must have a compliant client.  The only one I
ser2net: know of is kermit (http://www.columbia.edu/kermit).
