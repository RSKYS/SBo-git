This is a small program written to give unpriviledged users access to
realtime scheduling via the new rlimits added to kernel 2.6.12. The
new name reflects the fact that the program can control resource
limits rather than just those related to realtime priorities.

set_rlimits was developed by Jonathan Woithe
