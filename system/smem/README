smem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux
systems.  Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size
(PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of
memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.

Optional dependency: matplotlib (for chart generation)
