snapscreenshot (screenshot program for text consoles)

snapscreenshot creates a .tga (Targa) image file from the text contents
of the Linux framebuffer consoles (by default, all of the consoles,
tiled in a single image).

This probably doesn't work for non-framebuffer consoles (not tested).

By default, snapscreenshot is installed setuid root and executable by
users in the 'video' group. Normally on Slackware, users logged in at
the console are in the 'video' group by default. If you don't like this,
export SETUID=no in the script's environment. This will require root
access (e.g. su or sudo) for snapscreenshot to work.

See NOTES.txt for more information.
