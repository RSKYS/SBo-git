SPICE guest tools for Windows virtual machines.

This package contains the Windows spice-guest-tools installer ISO
image that you can attach to your Windows QEMU/KVM virtual machines.

The installer contains the following components:
- SPICE vdagent,
- QEMU guest agent,
- Windows Virtio drivers.

If the optional dependency p7zip is installed, Windows Virtio drivers
floppy disk images are packaged too.

The purpose of these images is to provide instant access to the Windows
Virtio drivers. In particular, the drivers can be easily accessed during
the Windows installation phase. This allows, for example, to install
the guest using Virtio SCSI disk directly, instead of first going
through the installation of the standard IDE disk controller.
