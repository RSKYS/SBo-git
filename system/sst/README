sst (Solidigm Storage Tool) is a proprietary command-line tool to
manage Solidigm SSDs (former Intel SSDs). It provides firmware update
capability as well as reading and setting many configuration settings.

To work with SATA drives sst requires the sg kernel module. To have
this module loaded on boot, please uncomment the corresponding line in
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local
