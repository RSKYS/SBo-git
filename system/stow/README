GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of
software and/or data located in separate directories on the
filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place.

This is particularly useful for keeping track of system-wide and
per-user installations of software built from source, but can also
facilitate a more controlled approach to management of configuration
files in the user's home directory, especially when coupled with
version control systems.

Stow is implemented as a combination of a Perl script providing a CLI
interface, and a backend Perl module which does most of the work. Stow
is Free Software, licensed under the GNU General Public License.
