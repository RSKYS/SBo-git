# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

swapinzram: assigned to it is only used for swapping as-needed (until then, the
swapinzram: RAM is still available for use by applications).
swapinzram: Swap data stored is compressed thereby allowing more data to be
swapinzram: stored in RAM.
