# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

swun:
swun: Swun is a very simple Update notifier, which places itself as an
swun: icon into the notification area of the desktop environment.
swun: It simply checks for changes to the ChangeLog with slackpkg
swun: (using "check-updates") and changes the icon color accordingly.
swun: It then offers the choice to run an interactive update via a terminal.
