DKMS module for controlling the System76 Io board, which is used in
System76's Thelio desktop line.

This driver provides hwmon interfaces for fan control, and tells the Io
board when the system is suspending. Decisions on fan speeds are made in
system76-power.

To ensure loading of the system76-io kernel module, you may need to add
modprobe system76-io
to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local.

The system76-io dkms module is automatically registered with dkms by
doinst.sh with the following command:

dkms install system76-io/$VER

A douninst.sh script is included which calls "dkms remove" to delete all
kernel versions of the old module on package removal or upgrade.
