system76-power is a utility for managing graphics and power profiles.

When run in daemon mode, system76-power manages the fan speed of fans
connected to the System76 Io board on Thelio desktops.

To start the daemon at boot, add the following to your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local script and make sure rc.system76-power has executable
permissions set:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.system76-power ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.system76-power start
  fi

The system76-power daemon log messages are logged to
/var/log/system76-power.log by default.  Logging can be disabled by
setting LOG_FILE=/dev/null in /etc/rc.d/rc.system76-power.

This project is pinned to a specific Rust version, currently 1.41.0.  As
such, rustup is a compile time only dependency.  If this specific
version of the Rust toolchain is not already installed, it will be
downloaded and installed automatically during build script execution.
It can be installed manually beforehand by running
  rustup toolchain install 1.41.0

NOTE: The directions in rustup's README must be followed so that the
rust installed by rustup is preferred over the system rust.
