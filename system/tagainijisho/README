Tagaini Jisho is designed to help you remember Japanese vocabulary
and kanji (later referred as 'entries') by presenting them in a way
that makes it easy to create connections between them. It does so by
keeping track of all the entries you already know and want to study,
and letting you tag and annote them, in addition to providing easy
navigation between related entries. A powerful search engine also
allows you to search for entries very precisely. Finally, Tagaini let
you produce printed material (including a handy foldable pocket book)
so let you study anywhere.

MultiMarkdown is an optional requirement needed to build the docs.
