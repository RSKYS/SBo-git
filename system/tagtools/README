tagtools (Simple Separate tagfiles for Slackware)

tagtools is a tool that automates the separation of tagfile in Slackware
Linux.
Basically it downloads from the official slackware mirror of each
series its respective tagfile.

What is Tagfile?
The tagfile is used in the Slackware installation script, and you
can create a custom install through the tagpath option in the Slackware
installer with these tagfiles. Options found in the tagfile:

REC, OPT, ADD, SKP
REC: Recommended
OPT: Optional
ADD: Add
SKP: Jump

Mode of Use
The first thing that needs to be done is to set the variable 'setlink'
which will be the mirror used. Note that in front of each mirror there
is the numbering [0] [1] [2] etc ... After choosing the required version
mirror you need to just set the 'setlink' number. Simple and FAST.
