targetcli-fb is a command-line interface for configuring the LIO
generic SCSI target, present in 3.x Linux kernel versions and up.

This package is the community fork or "Free Branch" of the original
Datera/RisingTide package.  It installs two additional python libraries:
configshell-fb and rtslib-fb.

If you already have the Datera/RisingTide version installed, it will be
overwritten.  Please ensure you have a backup if you want to keep it.

Ensure these kernel modules are loaded:
  target_core_mod, iscsi_target_mod
