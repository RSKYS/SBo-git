# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

terminator: The goal of this project is to produce a useful tool for arranging
terminator: terminals. It is inspired by programs such as gnome-multi-term,
terminator: quadkonsole, etc. in that the main focus is arranging terminals in
terminator: grids (tabs is the most common default method, which Terminator also
terminator: supports).
