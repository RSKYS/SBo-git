ti99sim (emulator for TI-99/4A computer)

ti99sim emulates the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A computer. It supports
emulated disk drives, joysticks, speech synthesis, and various other
hardware.

The package includes the system ROMs and a large collection of
cartridge ROM images installed in /opt/ti99sim/cartridges.

See /usr/doc/ti99sim-$VERSION/README.html for documentation. Although
there's a desktop menu launcher, you'll have to use the command line
to run cartridges and disk images.

Note: because some of the utilities have very generic names (such as
"disk", "decode", "say"), they're installed in /usr/bin with the
prefix ti99sim- (e.g. "ti99sim-disk"). If you really want to call
them by their original names, try:

  export PATH=/opt/ti99sim/bin:$PATH
