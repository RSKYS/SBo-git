TIGER, or the 'tiger' scripts, is a set of Bourne shell scripts,
C programs and data files which are used to perform a security audit
of UNIX systems.  It is designed to hopefully be easy to use, easy to
understand and easy to enhance.

'tiger' incorporates checks primarily oriented towards Linux integrity
including: md5sums checks installed files, (and it can call AIDE or
Intergrit aswell), analysis of local listening processes, and then some.

Tiger uses 'chkrootkit' for rootkit scanning if it's present.
