TinyVM is a virtual machine with the goal of having a small footprint.
Low memory usage, a small amount of code, and a small binary.

Building can be accomplished on UNIX-like systems with make and GCC.

There are no external dependencies, save the C standard library.

There are some included example programs that will be installed to:

  /usr/doc/tinyvm-$VERSION/programs/

The main executable is `tvmi`.

TinyVM does NOT implement a "real" architecture such as x86 or arm. In
other words, it's not a replacement for qemu or virtualbox. The VM
implemented here is loosely based on the x86 architecture, but highly
simplified.
