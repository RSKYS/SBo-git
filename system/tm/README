* tm - tmux manager/helper

This is a shell script used to ease day-to-day work with tmux (included
with Slackware). It allows easy handling of various types of tmux sessions,
as well as complex setups. It is mainly useful for using tmux as a
ssh-multiplexer and replacement for clusterssh though its happy to do any
other tmux session too.

"tm" can be driven directly from the command line or by using
repeatable session files. See /usr/doc/tm-yyyymmdd/README.org & examples/

To create a repeatable tm/tmux session file:
create folder: ~.tmux.d
create file: remotes (example)

REMOTES
NONE
root@remote_host1
root@remote_host2

The stock Slackware /etc/tmux.conf file can be modified to work better with
multiple tmux panes. These changes help if replacing clusterssh with tm/tmux.
The lines below are copied from /usr/doc/tmux-x.x/example_tmux.conf
and added to a stock Slackware /etc/tmux.conf.

# Turn the mouse on, but without copy mode dragging
set -g mouse on
unbind -n MouseDrag1Pane
unbind -Tcopy-mode MouseDrag1Pane

# Keys to toggle monitoring activity in a window, and synchronize-panes
bind m set monitor-activity
bind y set synchronize-panes\; display 'synchronize-panes #{?synchronize-panes,on,off}'
