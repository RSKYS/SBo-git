# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tmpwatch: tmpwatch (A utility for removing temporary files)
tmpwatch:
tmpwatch: The tmpwatch utility recursively searches through specified
tmpwatch: directories and removes files which have not been accessed in a
tmpwatch: specified period of time.  Tmpwatch is normally used to clean up
tmpwatch: directories which are used for temporarily holding files (for example,
tmpwatch: /tmp).  Tmpwatch ignores symlinks, won't switch filesystems and only
tmpwatch: removes empty directories and regular files.
