tp_smapi (SMAPI BIOS access for ThinkPad Laptops)

ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS
(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.

WARNING:
This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
(especially to models on which it wasn't tested).

NOTES:
* The source code of this package is from a tp_smapi fork:
