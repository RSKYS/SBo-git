Trusted Path Execution is a security feature that denies users from executing
programs that are not owned by root, or are writable. This closes the door on a
whole category of exploits where a malicious user tries to execute his or her
own code to attack the system.

Since this module doesn't use any kind of ACLs, it works out of the box with no
configuration. It isn't complicated to test or deploy to current production
systems. Just install it and you're done!
