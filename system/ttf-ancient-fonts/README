ttf-ancient-fonts (Unicode fonts for ancient scripts)

These are free unicode fonts for Aegean Scripts, other ancient scripts
in the greater Aegean vicinity, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, Sumero-Akkadian
Cuneiform, and Musical Symbols in the Unicode Standard.

Despite the "ttf" in the name, the package includes a few .otf fonts
as well.

The fonts installed by this package include hinting, by default. If you
for some reason require unhinted fonts, export HINTS=no in the
environment before running the SlackBuild. If you don't know what font
hinting is, you probably shouldn't worry about it.

The source tarball contains an older version of the Symbola font.
By default it's not included here, as there's already a symbola-font-ttf
on SBo. It's a much newer version of Symbola, but is licensed under
highly restrictive terms. If you'd rather have the older but free-to-use
version of Symbola, set SYMBOLA=yes in the environment for this build,
and don't install symbola-font-ttf.
