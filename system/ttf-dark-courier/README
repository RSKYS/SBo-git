ttf-dark-courier (HP font based on courier-new)

Originally distributed by Hewlett-Packard many years ago. Dark
Courierâ€™s main goal is to make Courier-New more readable by making
it heavier and darker on the page. The slightly darker font gives
greater readability while being identical to the original courier-new
font shipped with Windows operating systems.

These fonts will not overwrite courier-new or any other variant.
It is safe to install along side the webcore-fonts package.
