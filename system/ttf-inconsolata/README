ttf-inconsolata (Monospace Font)

Inconsolata is a Monospace font for pretty code listings and for the
terminal.

Inconsolata was Raph Levien's first serious original font release.
It is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the
like. There are a great many “programmer fonts,” designed primarily
for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention
to detail for high resolution rendering.
