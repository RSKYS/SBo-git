This program creates 'font.dir' files for TrueType fonts. These files
are required if you want to use TrueType fonts with X.

There is no website, since the tool has been abandoned.
RedHat still seems to be making patches from time to time.

It has been superseded by mkfontscale and mkfontdir,
but Cinelerra only works with this one.
