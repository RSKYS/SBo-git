expected by some software:

    /usr/share/zoneinfo/leap-seconds.list 

The IANA keeps the data and code used to create the Time Zone Database,
("tz", "tzdb", "zoneinfo").

This file comes from the commit for a tagged release from the
maintainer's repo:

Slackware installs the current glibc-zoneinfo-* package, but does not
include the leap-seconds.list file.
