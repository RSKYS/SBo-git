udevil (removable devices manager)

udevil is a command line Linux program which mounts and unmounts
removable devices without a password, shows device info, and monitors
device changes. It can also mount ISO files, nfs://, smb://, ftp://,
ssh:// URLs, and tmpfs/ramfs filesystems.
udevil is highly configurable, requires no daemon running, and depends
only on udev and glib (if it's not clear yet, no polkit needed!).
To use it, just prefix a normal mount command with "udevil".

It's reccomended for proper autodetection of removable devices to
enable kernel polling. You can do it adding this line to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local (the value is in milliseconds, higher means slower
detection but lower overhead):

echo 3000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs

zenity is an optional dependency.
