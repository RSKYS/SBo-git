uhuctl is a utility to control USB power per-port on smart USB hubs.
Smart hub is defined as one that implements per-port power switching.

Some hub give false report (lsusb -v) that they support per-port
power switching.

It also works for devices that support unbind. Example: you want to
disconnect a device programmatically, but no physically. In this case
the usb has still power but the device 'unplugs'.

Original idea for this code was inspired by hub-ctrl.c by Niibe Yutaka:
