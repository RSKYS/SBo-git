# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

unigine-heaven-benchmark: Heaven Benchmark is a GPU-intensive benchmark that hammers graphics
unigine-heaven-benchmark: cards to the limits. This powerful tool can be effectively used
unigine-heaven-benchmark: to determine the stability of a GPU under extremely stressful
unigine-heaven-benchmark: conditions, as well as check the cooling system's potential
unigine-heaven-benchmark: under maximum heat output.
