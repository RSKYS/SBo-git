# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

unison: unison (file-synchronization tool)
unison:
unison: Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
unison: two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on
unison: different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
unison: separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in
unison: each replica to the other.
unison: Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with
unison: updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates
unison: that do not conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates
unison: are detected and displayed.
