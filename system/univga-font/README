univga-font (unicode terminal font)

UNI-VGA is a Unicode VGA font for X11 and console. It is primarily
intended to be the single source of fonts for console and for MS-DOS
emulators.

One of the aims while creating the font was its internal consistency.
For example, accented glyphs shouldn't differ too much from unaccented
ones, as it was in original IBM's VGA font. It also allows rendering
Latin Extended Additional glyphs with two accents, which was
impossible with IBM's accents' size.

X11 calls the font:
  -bolkhov-vga-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1
...and an alias called "univga" is added, so you can say e.g.:
  xterm -fn univga

In most applications' font pickers, the font is just "VGA".

Also 3 varieties of the font are installed for use with
the Linux console: AsianCyr-vga-8x16, WinCyr-vga-8x16, and
UniCyrX-vga-8x16. They can be used in /etc/rc.d/rc.font, but won't
show up in the setconsolefont menu.

By default, the BDF (old style X bitmap), PSF (Linux console), and
OTB (new style Pango/Harfbuzz bitmap) fonts are installed. If you for
some reason need it, you can also install the PCF (portable compiled
X font) version, with PCF=yes in the environment. You can also set
BDF=no, PSF=no, and/or OTB=no, if you want to omit one or more of
these font types. Setting all 4 variables to "no" is an error, though.
