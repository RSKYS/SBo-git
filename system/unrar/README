The UnRAR utility is a freeware program, distributed with source
code and developed for extracting, testing and viewing the contents
of archives created with the RAR archiver version 1.50 and above.
The UnRAR library is a minor part of the RAR archiver and contains
the RAR uncompression algorithm. UnRAR requires very small volume
of memory to operate. The UnRAR library can also be used by other
programs to extract RAR archives.
