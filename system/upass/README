upass (Console UI for pass)

Run upass and use the friendly console interface.

upass stores its config in ~/.config/kwpolska/upass/upass.ini (but it
respects XDG_CONFIG_HOME if you changed it). Available options:

keys - keybinding configuration. * help, display, copy, refresh,
search, quit - set key bindings for commands,

space-separated (eg. quit=q f10 will make q and f10 keybindings for
quit) uplevel_h - on/off, use the h key as a back button, make sure
to change your help key bindings downlevel_l - on/off, use the l key
to open directory/password
