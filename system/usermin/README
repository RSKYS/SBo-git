Usermin is a web-based interface for webmail, password changing,
mail filters, fetchmail and much more.
It is designed for use by regular non-root users on a Unix system,
and limits them to tasks that they would be able to perform if
logged in via SSH or at the console.

After installing:
- start the usermin modules: /etc/usermin/start
- login into webmin
- refresh webmin modules
- restart webmin. 

You will see a new menu called Usermin Configuration under Webmin.

By default usermin runs at port 20000. After the webmin service is
started, point your web browser to http://localhost:20000 and
login as normal user to use usermin.

NOTES:
If you want to use SSL/HTTPS support, change the ssl=0 into ssl=1 in
/etc/usermin/miniserv.conf.

By default, this script set usermin to be accessible only on localhost.
If you want global/public access, comment or remove this line in 
/etc/usermin/miniserv.conf: allow=127.0.0.1
