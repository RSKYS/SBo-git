v4l2loopback - a kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices

This module allows you to create "virtual video devices".
Normal (v4l2) applications will read these devices as if they
were ordinary video devices, but the video will not be read
from, e.g. a capture card or webcam, but instead video generated
by another application.

You must rebuild this package if you upgrade your kernel.
