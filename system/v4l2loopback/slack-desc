# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

v4l2loopback: v4l2loopback (kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices)
v4l2loopback:
v4l2loopback: This module allows you to create "virtual video
v4l2loopback: devices". Normal (v4l2) applications will read these
v4l2loopback: devices as if they were ordinary video devices, but
v4l2loopback: the video will not be read from, e.g. a capture card
v4l2loopback: or webcam, but instead video generated by another
v4l2loopback: application.
