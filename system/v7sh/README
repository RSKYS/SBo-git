v7sh (port of the original Steve Bourne shell from 1978)

This is Nikola Vladov's port of the V7 Unix Bourne shell to
modern systems, based on Geoff Collyer's port. It functions
almost identically to the original Bourne shell, with some slight
differences, and one major one: The original V7 shell didn't support
comments with the # character, but this one does.

Installing this package adds /bin/v7sh to /etc/shells. The man page is
also called v7sh, though it calls itself "sh" in the text.
