Vagrant Public Key

Preparing a Vagrant virtual machine to be used as a base box
requires the installation of a ssh public key.  This package provides
the key and a script called vagrant-basebox to both install the key
and perform some setup of the system.

THIS PACKAGE WILL MAKE THE MACHINE IT'S INSTALLED ON INSECURE, USE ONLY
WHEN CREATING A VAGRANT BASE BOX FOR SHARING ON VAGRANT CLOUD.
