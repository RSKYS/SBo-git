# Important Note
This package will remove "vim" official package.

Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor vi. Many new
features have been added: multi level undo, command line history,
filename completion, block operations, and more.

Vim's development is led by Bram Moolenaar.

This package also contains the Exuberant Ctags program
written by Darren Hiebert.
