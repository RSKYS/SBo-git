This is the userspace part of the VirtualBox Guest Additions.
Together with virtualbox-kernel-addons they enable shared folders,
shared clipboard, etcetera, inside your Slackware guest machines.

See README.SLACKWARE for setup information.

This package is intended to be used on GUEST / VIRTUAL MACHINES running
Slackware, NOT the host system.
