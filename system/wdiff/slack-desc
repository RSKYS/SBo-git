# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wdiff: wdiff (display word differences between text files)
wdiff:
wdiff: The GNU wdiff program is a front end to diff for comparing files on
wdiff: a word per word basis. A word is anything between whitespace. This is
wdiff: useful for comparing two texts in which a few words have been changed
wdiff: and for which paragraphs have been refilled. It works by creating
wdiff: two temporary files, one word per line, and then executes diff on
wdiff: these files. It collects the diff output and uses it to produce a
wdiff: nicer display of word differences between the original files.
