# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wine-staging: wine-staging (Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org)
wine-staging:
wine-staging: It contains bug fixes and features, which have not been integrated
wine-staging: into the development branch yet. The idea of Wine Staging is to
wine-staging: provide experimental features faster to end users and to give
wine-staging: developers the possibility to discuss and improve their patches
wine-staging: before they are integrated into the main branch.
