Winetricks is an easy way to work around problems in Wine.

It has a menu of supported games/apps for which it can do all the
workarounds automatically. It also lets you install missing DLLs or
tweak various Wine settings individually.

This build script uses a snapshot of the winetricks script.

Winetricks is run on the command line.
In order to have a GUI, install zenity which is also available at
slackbuilds.org.
