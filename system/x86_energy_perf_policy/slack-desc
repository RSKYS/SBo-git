# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

x86_energy_perf_policy: x86_energy_perf_policy (set performance vs energy savings policy)
x86_energy_perf_policy:
x86_energy_perf_policy: x86_energy_perf_policy allows software to convey its policy for
x86_energy_perf_policy: the relative importance of performance versus energy savings to
x86_energy_perf_policy: the processor. The processor uses this information in model-specific
x86_energy_perf_policy: ways when it must select trade-offs between performance and energy
x86_energy_perf_policy: efficiency.
