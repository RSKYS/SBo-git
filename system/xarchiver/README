Xarchiver is a lightweight desktop independent archive manager
built with the GTK+2 toolkit. It is a Desktop Environment independent
archiver frontend.

All common archive types are supported, like zip, arj, bzip2, gzip, rar,
lha, lzma, lzop, deb, rpm, tar and zip archives. To run it you only need
GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various external utilities for these
archive types.
