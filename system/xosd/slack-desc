# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xosd: xosd (On Screen Display)
xosd:
xosd: XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right? The
xosd: difference is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent.
xosd: This gives the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc.
xosd: The package also includes an xmms plugin, which automatically
xosd: displays various interesting things as they change (song name,
xosd: volume etc...)
