Yabsm (yet another btrfs snapshot manageer) is a btrfs snapshot
manager and backup system.

To have the yabsm daemon start and stop with your host, add the
following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.yabsm ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.yabsm start
  fi

and add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if
needed):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.yabsm ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.yabsm stop
  fi

Yabsm is configured via the /etc/yabsm.conf file. On installation, an
example configuration will be installed to /etc/yabsm.conf.example.
This example configuration is well documented and can be used (along
with the manual) to help you create your own configuration.
