yaze-ag is designed to provide an exact simulation of the Z80
microprocessor. It is fast, emulates undocumented opcodes, and
passes instruction regression tests against real Z80 hardware.
NEW in yaze-ag version 2.xx is the support of an emulated Memory
Management Unit (MMU) and the BIOS which supports CP/M 3.1.

YAZE-AG is a Z80-CPU-Emulator and NOT a CP/M-Emulator!

Inside the Emulator runs an original CP/M or a replacement of CP/M.

YAZE-AG uses the free CP/M 3.1 replacement "ZPM3N10" of Simeon Cran
(bootfile "yaze-cpm3.boot") or the CP/M 2.2 replacement "Superdos"
(bootfile "yaze.boot").

(Optionally) when building on x84_64 you can specify an alternative
Makefile like this:

./yaze-ag.SlackBuild  Makefile_linux_64_intel_corei7
./yaze-ag.SlackBuild  Makefile_linux_64_intel_nocona
./yaze-ag.SlackBuild  Makefile_linux_64_intel_skylake
./yaze-ag.SlackBuild  Makefile_linux_64_intel_tigerlake
./yaze-ag.SlackBuild  Makefile_linux_64_amd_athlon64

emulator.
