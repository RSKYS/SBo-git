# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

z: 'frecent' directory that matches ALL of the regexes given on the
z: command line, in order. For example, z foo bar would match /foo/bar
z: but not /bar/foo.
