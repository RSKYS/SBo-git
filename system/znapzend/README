ZnapZend is a ZFS centric backup tool to create snapshots and send
 them to backup locations. It relies on the ZFS tools snapshot,
 send and receive to do its work. It has the built-in ability to
 manage both local snapshots as well as remote copies by thinning
 them out as time progresses.

The ZnapZend configuration is stored as properties in the ZFS
 filesystem itself.

Does not require zfs but is mostly useless without it.
