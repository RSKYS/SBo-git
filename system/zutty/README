zutty (X terminal emulator using OpenGL ES Compute Shaders)

Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally 
similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and 
countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern, 
GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty. What 
really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely 
efficient rendering implementation, coupled with a sufficiently 
complete feature set to make it useful for a wide range of users. Zutty 
offers high throughput with low latency, and strives to conform to 
relevant (published or de-facto) standards. 

Zutty is written in straightforward C++ and only relies on OpenGL 
ES 3.1 for rendering, making it trivially portable to windowing systems 
other than X and operating systems other than Linux. Zutty provides a 
clean implementation written from scratch, resulting in a minimal, 
maintainable, modern codebase unencumbered by historical baggage.
