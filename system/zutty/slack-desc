# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zutty:
zutty: Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
zutty: similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt and
zutty: countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern,
zutty: GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty. What
zutty: really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely
zutty: efficient rendering implementation.
